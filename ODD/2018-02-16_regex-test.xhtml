        <p>For this exam, we are asking you to up-convert a one-act play called <a href="linked_txt_file"/><em>The Bicyclers and Three Other Farces</em> using Regular Expressions. Please
        copy and paste the linked file into a txt file in &lt;oXygen/&gt; and use the Regex search and replace function to add structural tags to the play. The up-converted text should
        include wrapper tags for the following items:</p>
        <p>You may use any reference material you would like while creating your schema (books,
            Internet, etc.), except that you may not request or accept help from any other person
            (in this class or elsewhere). Should you have any questions about the test, please post
            them in our <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/drupal/">Relax NG discussion forum</a>.
            When you are finished, upload your schema to CourseWeb, where we have created an
            <q>assignment</q> for it (you do not need to upload the XML).</p>
