            <p>Welcome to the project site for the <em>Lega Toscana di Protezione</em>. This
                research was conducted by four student researchers and one faculty researcher from
                the <a href="http://frenchanditalian.pitt.edu">Department of French and Italian</a>
                and with consultation from various academic disciplines and specialties, both on
                Pitt's main and satellite campuses.</p>
            <p>This research project is a multi-dimensional look into the members who comprised the
                    <em>Lega Toscana di Protezione</em>, a Pittsburgh-based beneficial group that
                was exclusive to Tuscan immigrants living in the Pittsburgh area. Using archived
                documents from the <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/detre-library-archives">Senator John
                    Heinz History Center's Detre Library &amp; Archives</a> as a repository of
                primary sources, the researchers combed through the Tuscan League's minute logs,
                application materials from the Tuscan Women's Auxiliary, and digitized newspaper
                entries on individual League members to construct a composite portrait of what this
                group was, who ascribed to it, and how they interacted with each other and with the
                greater area around them.</p>
            <p>The majority of primary source materials regarding <em>la Lega Toscana</em>, its
                sister organization, the Women's Auxiliary, and its members were graciously provided
                by the <a target="_blank" href="http://heinzhistorycenter.org">Heinz History
                    Center</a> for academic use. The archived <em>Lega Toscana di Protezione</em>
                minutes are available for free, in-house study at the Detre Library and Archives in
                Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
            <p>The primary objective of this webpage is to both inform users of the interpersonal
                mechanisms that drove this organization, as well as to provide a free, open-source,
                online location to study, or to simply browse, the minute manuscripts, transcriptions
                of those manuscripts, or our translation of the volume.</p>
