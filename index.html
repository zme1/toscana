            <p>Welcome to the project site for the Lega Toscana di Protezione. This research was
                conducted by four student researchers and one faculty researcher from the <a
                    href="http://frenchanditalian.pitt.edu">Department of French and Italian</a> and
                with consultation from various academic disciplines and specialties, both on Pitt's
                main and satellite campus.</p>
            <p>This research project is a multi-dimensional look into the members who comprised the
                Lega Toscana di Protezione, a Pittsburgh-based beneficial group that was exclusive
                to Tuscan immigrants living in the Pittsburgh area. Using archived documents from
                the Heinz History Center as a repository of primary sources, the researchers combed
                through Lega minute logs, application materials from the Tuscan Women's Auxiliary,
                and newspaper entries on individual Lega members to construct a composite portrait
                of what this group was, who ascribed to it, and how they interacted with each other
                and with the greater area around them.</p>
            <p>The majority of primary source materials regarding the Lega Toscana, its sister
                organization the Women's Auxiliary, and its members were graciously provided by the
                    <a href="http://heinzhistorycenter.org">Heinz History Center</a> for academic
                use. The archived Lega Toscana minutes are available for free, in-house study at the
                Detre Library and Archives in Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
            <p>The primary objective of this webpage is to both inform users of the interpersonal
                mechanisms that drove this organization, as well as to provide a free, open-source,
                online location to study the minute manuscripts, transcriptions of those
                manuscripts, or translations of the volume of minutes.</p>
