Questions to Analyze on anglicisms in the volume:

How did the gross appearance of anglicisms change over time?
    * Raw count of the appearance of w elements over time
    * Token analysis of ratio Italian terms to English in each year
    - Simple histogram or line graph
    - Distinguish different secretaries (in all visualizations?)
How did the functional use of anglicisms change over time (i.e. The use of anglicisms in prose or in titles)
    * Comparison of w elements with ancestor roleName or note elements and w elements without those ancestors
    - Same approach as above
Which orthography prevailed in the minutes, and in which contexts?
    * Comparison of @tos:orth='eng' and @tos:orth='it' over time
    - Line graph that compares the English and Italian orthographies 
    - Anglicisms that appeared in prose, versus anglicisms that appeared in lists or titles
Were the anglicisms used grammatically (i.e. Were they inflected to agree in different lexical contexts?)? Was grammatical use more common with outright loans or italianized forms?
    * @tos:accordo='y' versus @tos:accordo='n'
Were anglicisms gendered? Outright loans (@tos:modification='n') or italianized forms (@tos:modification='y')?
