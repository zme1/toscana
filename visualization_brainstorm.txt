VISUALIZATIONS TO MAKE:

Social Network of proposals, including values for types of proposals (edge color?), who proposes vs. who supports more (node gradient change?), who
participates the most (node size?), and analyzing several different types of centrality and closeness.

Flow of members in and out of the group over time (tracking aggregated numbers and also seeing who leaves vs. who enters)

Who gets compensated by the Lega the most frequently and who gets the most money in compensation (two visualizations, one illustrating
iterations, and the other illustrating cash totals)

Officer vs. General member participation over the span of time (year-by-year)

Officer absences over time (year-by-year)

Activity of presidents during their administrative year in relation to off-years

Just out of interest... Seeing which members are mentioned only once

Members on committees -- Showing who appeared on different committees and how many (and what types?)

Positions of power on committees -- showing who had which roles for committees (stacked bar chart?)
