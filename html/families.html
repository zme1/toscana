            <h3>Family Biographies</h3>
            <img class="news" src="../img/newspaper.png" alt="newspaper" />
            <p class="news">Members of the Tuscan League were all Itlian immagrants who, perhaps
                suprisingly, had a healthy range in professional careers, political affiliations,
                and immigration histories. Ranging from architects to fruit vendors, with butchers,
                printers and painters in between, it is clear that the need for a supportive
                community and a type of insurance was present among many Tuscan immigrants
                regardless of financial situation. There were members who had been in the United
                States for over two decades, like Stefano Maffei and Muzio Frediani, and others who
                emigrated from Italy in the 1910’s and 1920’s. This indicates that the need for a
                community of culturally-alike people exists in naturalized citizens as much as it
                did for <q>aliens.</q>
                <cite>The Unione</cite>, the Italian language publication of the Frediani Printing
                Co., helped to prepare Italian immigrants for citizenship tests and was often a
                vessel by which immigrants could assimilate to life in Pittsburgh.</p>
            <p class="news">As stated before, there was a wide range of political views among
                members of the Tuscan League. <cite>The Frediani Printing Co</cite>. was influential
                in local and state-wide elections because it provided many resources and different
                kinds of support to the Republican party as a direct result of Victor Frediani's
                political involvement. Romeo Maffei, a first-generation Italian American and the son
                of Stefano Maffei, was a leader of the Young Democrats of Pittsburgh and often
                represented a large community of Italian democrats. The sons of two of the most
                influential members of the League held important roles in the politics of Pittsburgh
                and yet, their families worked together very often to execute League's events. It is
                clear that the Tuscan League, in their acceptance of new members, was mostly only
                concerned that the new member was healthy and Tuscan, which allowed them to build a
                community that was representative of the larger Pittsburgh Italian immigrant
                community.</p>

                families of the Tuscan League.</p>

                    <h3 class="fam">The Frediani Family</h3>
                    <p>Muzio Frediani immigrated to the United States from Livorno (Leghorn), Italy
                        in 1903 when he was eighteen years old. He was apprenticing to be a printer,
                        which he began doing at age twelve. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Frediani
                        Printing Co. which published <cite>the Unione</cite>, an Italian-American
                        publication that would be the official newspaper of the Italian Sons and
                        Daughters. The Italian Sons and Daughters of America (ISDA) is an
                        organization that formed in Pittsburgh, of which Frediani was a founding
                        member, as a way for Italian immigrants to preserve their culture and
                        language. Muzio met his first wife, Anna Frediani, in Italy. After her
                        death, Muzio later remarried Ruffina Diana of Pittsburgh, another Italian
                        immigrant. He resided on Webster Ave for the entirety of his time in
                        Pittsburgh, in an immigrant community comprised of many Syrian and
                        Palestinian immigrants. Anna and Muzio had six children. Victor, the eldest,
                        became a printer just like his father. With his younger brothers, Lorenzo
                        and Robert, he ran Frediani Printing Co. after Muzio passed away in
                        1961.</p>
                    <p> Frediani Printing Co. was originally located in the Lower Hill District, but
                        they moved to current Liberty Ave location in 1956 due to zoning changes.
                            <cite>The Unione</cite> was integral to Italian immigrant life. One of
                        its main goals was to help prepare immigrants for the American citizenship
                        test. During World War II, it was a mouthpiece for Italian Americans to
                        express their dedication to the United States, which was under scrupulation
                        due to Italy’s role in the war. They were often printing statements like
                            <q>Next to God, our religion is America!</q> and <q>We owe respect to
                            the country of our birth, but absolute loyalty to the land of our
                            adoption.</q> Frediani Printing Co. also provided many resources for the
                        Republican party of Pittsburgh as a result of Victor's position as a staunch
                        Republican in the early half of the 20th century.</p>
                    <p>Muzio was a very influential member of the Tuscan League. His involvement
                        ranged from planning the countryside parties to keeping track of who wasn't
                        giving money to the League. He served as President, Correspondence
                        Secretary, Administrator and even as a printer for the organization. The
                        minutes make it clear that he was one of the more organized presidents,
                        placing a heavy importance on attendance and the maintenance of an energetic
                        attitude about the Tuscan League.</p>

                    <h3 class="fam">The Maffei Family</h3>
                    <p>Stefano Maffei immigrated to Pittsburgh in 1892 from Tuscany. He is one of
                        the founding members of the Tuscan Protection League, and one of the most
                        active according to the minutes. Stefano owned and operated a fruit and
                        confectionary store in the Strip District for most of his career. When he
                        first moved to the United States, he brought a small family with him. After
                        the tragic loss of a child in 1902 and the death of his first wife, Maria,
                        in 1917, he remarried Carola, another Italian immigrant, and started a new
                        family. His children remained in the Pittsburgh area. His second-oldest son,
                        Romeo, entered into politics and was very involved in the Pittsburgh
                        Democratic party.</p>
                    <p>Stefano was involved in multiple community organizations, like many other
                        members of the organization. He was a member of the Gabriele D’Annunzio
                        lodge and the Societa Fraterna of Pittsburgh. His ties to the Tuscan
                        Protection League were so strong that other influential members like Santino
                        Pasquinelli, Michele Simonetti and Emilio Pellegrini were pallbearers at the
                        funeral of his first wife. He was heavily involved with the planning of any
                        social event they held, and served as the President and Vice President.</p>

                    <h3 class="fam">The Pasquinelli Family</h3>
                    <p>Santino Pasquinelli immigrated to Pittsburgh in 1910 from Lucca, Italy. He
                        worked as a butcher at a shop that he owned with his brother, Americo, who
                        immigrated in 1900. Santino was much more involved in the Tuscan League than
                        his brother, although Americo was also a member. Santino was an incredibly
                        active member, often arranging the countryside parties and balls, and
                        serving as either the Finance Secretary and the Treasurer for the entire
                        duration of the first volume of the minutes. He is one of few members of the
                        Tuscan League that is specifically mentioned in the minutes for his
                        competency and consistency as both an officer and member.</p>
                    <p>On one occasion in the meeting minutes, Santino is the recipient of a
                        monetary gift from the League, in the name of his superb bookkeeping as
                        Treasurer in 1921. He also pleaded guilty to breaking Prohibition by
                        transporting and storing 100 bottles of whiskey in his home on Michigan Ave.
                        It was only two days prior to the arrest that the League proposed to give
                        Santino a gift for his commendable handling the money. Given this
                        information, a working theory for its motivations is that Santino was able
                        to provide alcohol for their beloved parties and as repayment, they
                        presented him with a <q>gift.</q></p>

                    <h3 class="fam">The Pellegrini Family</h3>
                    <p>Casimiro Pellegrini immigrated to Pittsburgh from Lucca, Italy in 1903 with
                        his mother and siblings to join his father, Emilio, an early member of the
                        Tuscan League. Emilio Pellegrini originally worked as a fruit merchant, like
                        many other Tuscan immigrants, but eventually found his place in shoemaking
                        and selling.</p>
                    <p>Casimiro, on the other hand, found his success in architecture. He graduated
                        from the Carnegie Technical School of Architecture in 1922, and in 1936, was
                        named the Pittsburgh city architect. He successfully ran a private
                        architecture firm which his son joined once he, too, became an architect.
                        Like many other Tuscan immigrants, Casimiro married another member of the
                        immigrant community, an Irish American named Marie O’Donnell. They had three
                        children, Casimiro Jr., Zelma, and Betsy, and they resided in Squirrel Hill
                        for their entire adult lives. Casimiro Jr. also studied to become an
                        architect at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. Zelma became a popular
                        figure in the Pittsburgh arts scene after graduating from the Juilliard
                        School of Music. She performed at the Carnegie Music Hall in Pittsburgh on
                        several occasions.</p>
                    <p> Casimiro was very community oriented. He served as the Correspondance
                        Secretary in 1920 and the President in 1924. In addition, Casimiro regularly
                        led committees and headed the Tuscan League's projects. His connection to
                        the religious community and the business sector provided the Lega Toscana
                        with many opportunities for outreach and fundraising. In addition to his
                        involvement in the Lega Toscana, he was a member of the Italian Sons and
                        Daughters of America, the Knights of Columbus, and the American Legion post
                        no. 557. He often traveled to Puerto Rico to assist in the design and
                        construction of churches, schools and hospitals.</p>

                    <h3 class="fam">The Zini Family</h3>
                    <p>Modesto Zini emigrated from Pescia, Italy in 1913. He resided on Climax
                        Street in Beltzhoover for much of his life in Pittsburgh. He began working
                        at Roma Bottling Co. shortly after his arrival to Pittsburgh and eventually
                        became the Vice President of the company. Even though his arrival to
                        Pittsburgh happened much later than many of the other members, he was a markedly
                        active member. His admittance to Tuscan League can be seen in the minutes,
                        in the May 20th, 1919 meeting. Modesto immediately volunteered to head the
                        planning of the countryside party and represent the organization at other
                        institutional events. Throughout the rest of the minutes, he regularly made
                        proposals and seconded others' proposals and volunteered for leadership
                        positions regarding the picnics and dances. At the end of the 1925 minutes,
                        Modesto was voted into the position of Vice President for 1926.</p>

            <h3>Where Members Lived, Worked, and Met</h3>
            <div class="mapping">
                <p>One of the truly digitally oriented portions of this research focused on where
                    the members of the Tuscan League lived and socialized, and how that changed over
                    the span of time. The maps provided below give some insight into the questions
                    of where the Tuscan population could be found, and how that evolved across
                    time.</p>
                <p class="para-gis"><a target="_blank" href="../img/res-map.png"><img id="house"

                         /></a> This map shows a view of about 400 residential and commercial spaces
                    noted in the League's meeting minutes, applications to the Women's Auxiliary of
                    the Tuscan League, newspaper clippings, and the census. The residences were organized
                    by decade, ranging from 1910 to 1958. Early on, members of the Tuscan League
                    lived in the Central Business District and the Lower Hill district. By the 1930s
                    most members moved to Beltzhoover (where the Tuscan League held their meetings),
                    Mount Washington, Beechview, and the Bluff. The data suggest that the Liberty
                    Tunnel, opened in 1924, enabled the Tuscan League's community to migrate from
                    Downtown to South Hills neighborhoods. Very few members lived outside of the
                    South Hills and urban Pittsburgh, although a few lived in Squirrel Hill, Belmar,
                    Emsworth, and Sewickley.</p>
