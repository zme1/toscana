            <h3>Family Biographies</h3>
            <img class="news" src="../img/newspaper.png" alt="newspaper" />
            <p class="news">Members of the Lega Toscand di Protezione were all Itlian immagrants
                who, perhaps suprisingly, had a healthy range in professional careers, political
                affiliations, and immigration histories. Ranging from architects to fruit vendors,
                with butchers, printers and painters in between, it is clear that the need for a
                supportive community and a type of insurance was present among many Tuscan
                immigrants regardless of financial situation. There were members who had been in the
                United States for over two decades, like Stefano Maffei and Muzio Frediani, and
                others who emigrated from Italy in the 1910’s and 1920’s. This indicates that the
                need for a community of culturally-alike people exists in naturalized citizens as
                much as it did for “aliens”. The Unione, the Italian language publication of the
                Frediani Printing Co., helped to prepare Italian immigrants for citizenship tests
                and was often a vessel by which immigrants could assimilate to life in
                Pittsburgh.</p>
            <p class="news">As stated before, there was a wide range of political views among
                members of the Lega. The Frediani Printing Co. was influential in local and
                state-wide elections because it provided many resources and different kinds of
                support to the Republican party as a direct result of Victor Frediani’s political
                involvement. Romeo Maffei, a first-generation Italian-American and the son of
                Stefano Maffei, was a leader of the Young Democrats of Pittsburgh and often
                represented a large community of Italian democrats. The sons of two of the most
                influential members of the Lega held important roles in the politics of Pittsburgh
                and yet, their families worked together very often to execute Lega events. It is
                clear that the Lega Toscana, in their acceptance of new members, was mostly only
                concerned that the new member was healthy and Tuscan, which allowed them to build a
                community that was representative of the larger Pittsburgh Italian immigrant
                community.</p>

                    <h3 class="fam">The Frediani Family</h3>
                    <p>Muzio Frediani immigrated to the United States from Livorno (Leghorn), Italy
                        in 1903 when he was eighteen years old. He was apprenticing to be a printer,
                        which he began doing at age twelve. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Frediani
                        Printing Co. which published the Unione, an Italian-American publication
                        that would become the first of its kind - The Unione is the oldest Italian
                        newspaper in the United States. Muzio met his first wife, Anna Frediani, in
                        Italy. After her death, Muzio eventually remarried Ruffina Diana of
                        Pittsburgh, another Italian immigrant. He resided on Webster Ave in for the
                        entirety of his time in Pittsburgh, in an immigrant community comprised of
                        many Syrian and Palestinian immigrants. Anna and Muzio had six children.
                        Victor, the eldest, became a printer just like his father. With his younger
                        brothers, Lorenzo and Robert, he ran Frediani Printing Co. after Muzio
                        passed away in 1961.</p>
                    <p>Frediani Printing Co. was originally located in the Lower Hill District, but
                        they moved to Liberty Ave, where they are located now, in 1956 due to zoning
                        changes. The Unione was integral to Italian immigrant life. One of its main
                        goals was to help prepare immigrants for the American citizenship test.
                        During World War II, it was a mouthpiece for Italian-Americans to express
                        their dedication to the United States, which was under scrupulation due to
                        Italy’s role in the war. They were often printing statements like “Next to
                        God, our religion is America!” and “We owe respect to the country of our
                        birth, but absolute loyalty to the land of our adoption.” The Unione was the
                        official paper of the Italian Sons and Daughters of America. Frediani
                        Printing Co. also provided a lot of resources for the Republican party of
                        Pittsburgh as a result of Victor’s position as a staunch Republican in the
                        early half of the 20th century.</p>
                    <p>Muzio was a very influential member of the Lega Toscana. His involvement
                        ranged from planning the countryside parties to keeping track of who wasn’t
                        giving money to the Lega. He served as president, correspondence secretary,
                        administrator and even as a printer for the Lega. The minutes make it clear
                        that he was one of the more organized presidents, placing a heavy importance
                        on attendance and the maintenance of an energetic attitude about the Lega.

                    <h3 class="fam">The Maffei Family</h3>
                    <p>Stefano Maffei immigrated to Pittsburgh in 1892 from Tuscany. He is one of
                        the founding members of the Lega Toscana, and one of the most active
                        according to the minutes. Stefano owned and operated a fruit and
                        confectionary store in the Strip District for most of his career. When he
                        first moved to the United States, he brought a small family with him. After
                        the tragic loss of a child in 1902 and the death of his first wife, Maria,
                        in 1917, he remarried Carola, another Italian immigrant, and started a new
                        family. His children remained in the Pittsburgh area. His second-oldest son,
                        Romeo, entered into politics and was very involved in the Pittsburgh
                        Democratic party. </p>
                    <p>Stefano was involved in multiple community organizations, like many other
                        Lega members. He was a member of the Gabriele D’Annunzio lodge and the
                        Societa Fraterna of Pittsburgh. His ties to the Lega Toscana was so strong
                        that other influential members like Santino Pasquinelli, Michele Simonetti
                        and Emilio Pellegrini were pallbearers at the funeral of his first wife. He
                        was heavily involved with the planning of any social event they held and as
                        well as Emilio Marchetti and Michele Simonetti.</p>

                <div class="famWrite" style="display: none;" id="para-pasquinelli">
                    <h3 class="fam">The Pasquinelli Family</h3>
                    <p>Santino Pasquinelli immigrated to Pittsburgh in 1910 from Lucca, Italy. He
                        worked as a butcher at a shop that he owned with his brother, Americo, who
                        immigrated in 1900. Santino was much more involved in the Lega Toscano,
                        though Americo was also a member. Santino was an especially active member,
                        often arranging the countryside parties and balls, but also served as the
                        Finance Secretary and the Treasurer. He is one of few Lega members that is
                        specifically mentioned in the minutes for his competency as an officer and
                        member.</p>
                    <p>On one occasion in the meeting minutes, Santino is the recipient of a
                        monetary gift from the Lega, in the name of his superb bookkeeping as
                        treasurer in 1921. He also plead guilty to breaking prohibition by
                        transporting and storing 600 bottles of whiskey in his home on Michigan Ave.
                        I theorize that Santino was able to provide the Tuscans with alcohol for
                        their parties that they were so fond of holding, and to repay him, they
                        presented him with “gifts”. (2 days prior to his big arrest, they suggest
                        paying him for handling the money so well...)</p>

                    <h3 class="fam">The Pellegrini Family</h3>
                    <p>Casimiro Pellegrini immigrated to Pittsburgh from Lucca, Italy in 1903 with
                        his mother and siblings to join his father, Emilio, an early member of the
                        Lega Toscana. Emilio Pellegrini originally worked as a fruit merchant , like
                        many other Tuscan immigrants, but eventually found his place in shoemaking
                        and selling. </p>
                    <p>Casimiro, on the other hand, found his success in architecture. He graduated
                        from the Carnegie Technical School of Architecture in 1922, and in 1936, was
                        named the Pittsburgh city architect. He successfully ran a private
                        architecture firm which his son joined once he, too, became an architect.
                        Like many other Tuscan immigrants, Casimiro married another member of the
                        immigrant community, an Irish-American named Marie O’Donnell. They had three
                        children, Casimiro Jr., Zelma and Betsy, and resided in Squirrel Hill for
                        their entire adult lives. Casimiro Jr. also studied to become an architect
                        at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. Zelma became a popular figure in
                        the Pittsburgh arts scene after graduating from the Juilliard School of
                        Music. She performed at the Carnegie Music Hall on several occasions.</p>
                    <p> Casimiro was very community oriented. He served as the president of the Lega
                        Toscana in 1924 and correspondence secretary in 1920. In addition, Casimiro
                        regularly led committees and headed Lega projects. His connection to the
                        religious community and the business sector provided the Lega Toscana with
                        many opportunities for outreach and fundraising. Besides his involvement in
                        the Lega Toscana, he was a member of the Italian Sons and Daughters of
                        America, the Knights of Columbus, and the American Legion post no. 557. He
                        often traveled to Puerto Rico to assist in the design and construction of
                        churches, schools and hospitals.</p>

                    <h3 class="fam">The Zini Family</h3>
                    <p>Modesto Zini emigrated from Pescia, Italy in 1913. He resided on Climax
                        Street in Beltzhoover for much of his life in Pittsburgh. He began working
                        at Roma Bottling Co. shortly after his arrival to Pittsburgh and eventually
                        became the Vice President of the company. Even though his arrival to
                        Pittsburgh happened much later than many of the other members, he was a very
                        involved member. His admittance to League can be seen in the minutes, in the
                        May 20th, 1919 meeting. Modesto immediately volunteered to head the planning
                        of the countryside party and represent the Lega at other institutions’
                        events. Throughout the rest of the minutes, he regularly made proposals and
                        seconded others’ proposals and volunteered for leadership positions
                        regarding the picnics and dances. At the end of the 1925 minutes, Modesto
                        was voted into the position of Vice President for 1926.</p>

            <h3>Where Members Lived, Worked, and Met</h3>
            <div class="mapping">
                <p>One of the truly digitally oriented portions of this research focused on where
                    the members of the Lega Toscana lived, socialized, and how that changed over the
                    span of time. The maps provided below give some insight into the questions of
                    where the Tuscan population could be found, and how that evolved with time.</p>

                         /></a> This map shows a view of about 400 residencial and commercial spaces
                    noted in Lega Toscana meeting minutes, applications to the Women's Auxiliary of
                    the Lega Toscana, newspaper clippings, and the census. I sorted the residences
                    by decade, ranging from 1910 to 1958. Early on, members of the Lega Toscana
                    lived in the Central Business District and Crawford-Roberts. By the 1930s most
                    members moved to Beltzhoover, Mount Washington, Beechview, and Bluff. The data
                    suggest that the Liberty Tunnel, opened in 1924, enabled the Lega Toscana
                    community to migrate from Downtown to South Hills neighborhoods. Very few
                    members lived outside of the South Hills and urban Pittsburgh, although a few
                    lived in Squirrel Hill, Belmar, Emsworth, and Sewickley.</p>

                    doing a Point Density Analysis in ArcMap on the residential dataset from the
                    first map. The darkest blue clouds show the most tightly clustered Lega member
                    residences, which appear in Beltzhoover, followed by Beechview, then Bluff. This
