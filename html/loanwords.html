        <h1>Anglicized Linguistic Conventions in the Lega Toscana</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>While the Tuscan League's records boasted plenty of research opportunity regarding
                member behaviors and relationships, another academically inviting component of the
                corpus included the organizations linguistic conventions -- specifically in their
                use of English loanwords in the volume. As a cultural organization, comprised
                entirely of Tuscan individuals, the Tuscan League unsurprisingly documented the
                meeting's proceedings in Italian. Interestingly, though, the five secretaries who
                transcribed these minutes all used English loanwords to some extent throughout their
                writing. The marked use of English in the volume led to the engagement with this
                corpus at a linguistic level, analyzing when and how English loanwords or words
                derived directly from English were used, and what it may say about the group's
                perceived English proficiency.</p>
            <p>The primary focus on this investigation is to identify how English is embedded into
                the otherwise Italian corpus at the linguistic level. To pursue this question,
                unadapted loans (i.e. entirely English, like <em>tickets</em>) and adapted loans
                (i.e.italianized words with an English derivative, like <em>le tichette</em>) were
                both flagged in the corpus, and several linguistic properties were documented. These
                properties primarily included their orthography; grammaticality; level of
                productivity; and, throughout the corpus, range of vocabulary, and a quantitative
                study of these traits may help to reveal the driving forces that impelled these
                uses, whether those are linguistic (i.e. evidence of English acquisition among
                members), cultural (i.e. an attempt to integrate the English lexicon without
                presupposing functional English knowledge), or a combination of the two.</p>
            <p>Below are various different analyses on how the Tuscans used English within the
                bounds of the minutes. These analyses scrutinised linguistic features of the words
                by observing which words were used, which orthographic system (English or Italian)
                prevailed and when, the productivity of different words in the volume, the context
                in which words were used, and whether the words were used in compliance with
                grammatical conventions. Please continue reading for more detailed information on
                the relationship between the Lega Toscana and their use of English.</p>

        <h2>The Appearance of Loanwords Over Time</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>One of the over-arching questions that drove this research was simply, <q>When do
                    English loanwords appear in the volume, and in which contexts do they
                    appear?</q> With the structural markup that demarcated both the time of meetings
                and, to an extent, the subject of discussion in the minutes, the answer to this
                question finds two primary contextual uses of loanwords -- either in general meeting
                proceedings, or in launching event plans and naming event committee members. The
                latter represents such an extensive portion of the minute volume simply because the
                Tuscan League received a generous proportion of both its member activity and
                organizational funds from their two large annual events, summer picnics and winter
                balls. Thus, it's unsurprising that much of their attention focused on the planning
                and execution of these events. Further, as the analyses indicate, much of the use of
                English is found in these event-based discussions, which merits the simple
                distinction in several visualizations between the English that appears in those
                moments, and English that appears elsewhere.</p>
            <p>As stated above, the volume of minutes was penned by five different officers
                throghout the seven year period, elected annually to the position of correspondence
                secretary. The histogram below represents the changes in transcribers in changes in
                background colors. The elected secretaries were the following: Michele Simonetti
                (1919), Muzio Frediani (1920), Emilio Marchetti (1921, 1922), Eugenio Merciadri
                (January-May 1923), and Giuseppe Gianni (June-December 1923, 1924, 1925). This
                change in transcriber is explicitly made in only the first graph, and in recognizing
                that, during his five-month tenure, Emilio Marchetti used only one English loanword,
                we can effectively attribute the final three years of the volume entirely to
                Giuseppe Gianni and, therefore, infer the changes in authorship with the start of
                new years.</p>
            <p>In the graph below, along with the following graph on orthographies that makes the
                same distinction, <q>event-based discussions</q> were identified by isolating text
                that named event committees, officers, and members and any additional notes on
                committee responsabilities. Loanwords that were found in any other context
                throughout the volume were compiled separately.</p>
