        <h1>Anglicized Linguistic Conventions in the Lega Toscana</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>While the Tuscan League's records boasted plenty of research opportunity regarding
                member behaviors and relationships, another academically inviting component of the
                corpus included the organizations linguistic conventions -- specifically in their
                use of English loanwords in the volume. As a cultural organization, comprised entirely of
                Tuscan individuals, the Tuscan League unsurprisingly documented the meeting's
                proceedings in Italian. Interestingly, though, the five secretaries who transcribed
                these minutes all used English loanwords to some extent throughout their writing.
                The marked use of English in the volume led to the engagement with this corpus at a
                linguistic level, analyzing when and how English loanwords or words derived directly
                from English were used, and what it may say about the group's perceived English
                proficiency.</p>
            <p>Below are various different analyses on how the Tuscans used English within the
                bounds of the minutes. These analyses scrutinised linguistic features of the words
                by observing which words were used, which orthographic system (English or Italian)
                prevailed and when, the productivity (varied contextual use) of different words in
                the volume, the context in which words were used, and whether the words were used in
                compliance with grammatical conventions. Please continue reading for more detailed
                information on the relationship between the Lega Toscana and their use of
                English.</p>
