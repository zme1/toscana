        <h1>Anglicized Linguistic Conventions in the Lega Toscana</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>While the Tuscan League's records boasted plenty of research opportunity regarding
                member behaviors and relationships, another striking component of the corpus
                included the organization's linguistic conventions -- specifically in their use of
                English loanwords in the volume. As a cultural organization of Tuscan individuals,
                the Tuscan League unsurprisingly documented the meeting's proceedings in Italian.
                Interestingly, though, the five secretaries who transcribed these minutes all used
                English loanwords to some extent throughout their writing. The marked use of English
                in the volume led to the engagement with this corpus at a linguistic level,
                analyzing when and how English loanwords or words derived directly from English were
                used, and what it may say about the group's perceived English proficiency.</p>
            <p>The primary focus on this investigation is to identify how English is embedded into
                the otherwise Italian corpus at the linguistic level. To pursue this question,
                    <em>unadapted loans</em> (i.e. entirely English, like <em>tickets</em>) and
                    <em>adapted loans</em> (i.e.italianized words with an English derivative, like
                    <em>le tichette</em>) were both flagged in the corpus, and several linguistic
                properties were documented. These properties primarily included their orthography,
                i.e., spelling system; grammaticality; level of productivity, i.e., range of
                contexts in which a term was used; and, throughout the corpus, range of vocabulary.
                A quantitative study of these traits may help to reveal the driving forces that
                impelled these uses, whether those are linguistic, i.e., evidence of English
                acquisition among members; cultural, i.e., an attempt to integrate the English
                lexicon without presupposing functional English knowledge; or some combination of
                the two.</p>
            <p>Below are various different analyses on how the Tuscans used English within the
                bounds of the minutes. These analyses scrutinised linguistic features of the words
                by observing which words were used, which orthographic system (English or Italian)
                prevailed and when, the productivity of different words in the volume, the context
                in which words were used, and whether the words were used in compliance with
                grammatical conventions. Please continue reading for more detailed information on
                the relationship between the Lega Toscana and their use of English.</p>

        <h2>The Appearance of Loanwords Over Time</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>One of the over-arching questions that drove this research was simply, <em>When do
                    English loanwords appear in the volume, and in which contexts do they
                    appear?</em> With the structural markup that demarcated both the time of
                meetings and, to an extent, the subject of discussion in the minutes, the answer to
                this question finds two primary contextual uses of loanwords -- either in general
                meeting proceedings, or in launching event plans and naming event committee members.
                The latter represents such an extensive portion of the minute volume simply because
                the Tuscan League received a generous proportion of both its member activity and
                organizational funds from their two large annual events, the summer picnic and the
                winter balls. Thus, it's unsurprising that much of their attention focused on the
                planning and execution of these events. Further, as the analyses indicate, much of
                the use of loanwords is found in these event-based discussions, which merits the
                simple distinction in several visualizations between the loanwords that appear in
                those moments, and those that appear elsewhere in the minutes.</p>
            <p>As stated above, the volume of minutes was penned by five different officers
                throghout the seven year period, elected annually to the position of correspondence
                secretary. Figure 1, below, represents the changes in transcribers with changes in
                background colors. The elected secretaries were the following: Michele Simonetti
                (1919), Muzio Frediani (1920), Emilio Marchetti (1921, 1922), Eugenio Merciadri
                (January-May 1923), and Giuseppe Gianni (June-December 1923, 1924, 1925). This
                change in transcriber is explicitly made in only the first graph, and in recognizing
                that, during his five-month tenure, Emilio Marchetti used only one English loanword,
                we can effectively attribute the final three years of the volume entirely to
                Giuseppe Gianni and, therefore, infer the changes in authorship with the start of
                new years.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 50px"><em style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 125%;"
                    >Note</em>: In October of 1924, Gianni wrote a generous portion of the minutes
                exclusively in English. Given the context and the stark difference in writing style
                and terms employed, it's assumed he transcribed an English invoice or series of
                receipts related to associated costs in their participation in a Columbus Day
                parade. This portion of the minutes was not considered for quantitative analysis in
                any of the visualizations or discussions below as a result. Read the digitized
                manuscript, transcription, or translation of that page <a target="_blank"
                    href="1924.html#pg128">here</a> to see that specific documentation.</p>
        </div>
        <!--#include virtual="ssi/visualizations/loan-count_raw.html" -->
        <div class="text">
            <p>In Figures 1 and 2, <em>event-based discussions</em> were identified by isolating
                text that named event committees, officers, and members and any additional notes on
                committee responsabilities. Loanwords that were found in any other context
                throughout the volume were compiled separately.</p>
            <p>The first and most telling observation to make from Figure 1 is that there is not
                much evidence to support use of English loanwords that transcended changes in
                transcribers. Each individual responsible for documenting the meetings seems to have
                his own pronounced use of loanwords during the time he held this position. Although
                there are generalizations we could make about the ues of loanwords in general, these
                generalizations may not fully represent the actual use of English for any individual
                correspondence secretary in the League.</p>
            <p>With that said, there is a loose correspondence between the amount of event-based
                discussions held in a year and the number of event-based contexts in which loanwords
                appear. For example, in both 1921 and 1922, the Lega held five different discussions
                on upcoming events, and other years either had only two (1919, 1923) or three (1920,
                1924, 1925) of those same discussions. In all but the first documented year,
                loanwords found some use in the context of these meetings.</p>
            <p>During these event discussions, the vast majority of English loanwords came to use in
                naming committee and event chairs. With Simonetti (1919), committee titles (e.g.
                    <em>chairman of arrangement</em>, <em>floor manager</em>, etc.) were written
                entirely in Italian, while other transcribers used only unadapted English
                equivalents -- like Marchetti (1921, 1922) -- or code-switched between the two
                languages -- like Gianni (1923, 1924, 1925). Near the end of the page, figure 4
                displays specific words used in a year, and the frequency with which they were
                used.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>The Use of Different Orthographic Systems</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>In addition to tracking raw counts of how loanwords appeared over time, the
                distinction between English and Italian orthographic systems was also a primary
                interest in this research. The orthographic systems were distinguished in attempt to
                discern whether the individual loanwords were adapted into Italian orthography (e.g.
                tichette) or unadapted, e.g., tickets. Analyzing this linguistic characteristic in
                conjunction with the contextual use of the words can help determine the extent to
                which the transcribers had a functional knowledge of English, or if its use was
                novel and motivated by extralinguistic factors, e.g., the <em>prestige factor</em>
                of using the commercially and culturally dominant English language in their own
                organization.</p>
            <p>Adapted loanwords may indicate more definitivey a functional knowledge of or comfort
                with English language in the fluidity with which they are incorporated into the
                Italian written language. After a loanword finds conventional use in the target
                language, that language's grammatical conventions will naturally begin to evolve the
                word to the point that it complies with those conventions. In this analysis, we
                refer to that process as <em>italianization.</em></p>
            <p>Unadapted loans generally indicate one of two things: either the speaker/writer is
                proficient in English to the point that he can freely code-switch between the host
                and target language, or the use of the loanword is novel and likely motivated by the
                    <em>prestige factor</em> of the host language -- which is to say, it is deemed
                socially advantageous to incorporate the host language into speech or writing
                without presupposing a knowledge of the language itself. With this dichotomy between
                highly proficient and unskilled users of loanwords, the context of use will inform
                whether the use of unadapted loanwords indicates proficiency in English or, instead,
                novel use of its words.</p>
        </div>
        <!--#include virtual="ssi/visualizations/orth.html" -->
        <div class="text">
            <p>Figure 2 illustrates two key factors in studying the compliance with English and
                Italian orthographic systems: whether a word was adapted or not, and whether that
                word appeared in the context of event discussions. The latter is incorporated into
                this visualization to establish the role that the loanwords likely played at that
                point in the minute log.</p>
            <p>Regarding event-based discussions, it's shown that the majority of those words were
                unadapted from English, with only a handful of exceptions between 1923 and 1925. Of
                those words, they were almost exclusively named positions of event and committee
                chairpersons, like <em>floor manager</em> and <em>chairman of arrangement
                    committee</em>, with one exception in 1920 in which the group curates a list of
                goods to offer at one of their major events.</p>
            <p>Between 1923 and 1925, some of the same names were given, but some were adapted into
                Italian, so instead of writing <em>chairman of arrangement committee</em>, Gianni
                occasionally wrote <em>capo di comitato arrangiamento</em>, with only the lattermost
                word qualifying as a loanword.</p>
            <p>Figure 2 also indicates that there different perceived levels of comfort with
                English, and despite a higher use of loanwords in 1921 and 1922 with Marchetti, he
                used a constricted range of terms in a much smaller context. Marchetti seems to be
                the greatest example of a prestige factor of English use influencing his use of it,
                rather than a functional knowledge of the language itself. In contrast, Gianni's
                entries between 1923 and 1925 are more indicative of a higher -- albeit not
                enormously so -- familiarity with English in his ability to adapt words into
                Italian and his tendency to use them in the prose of the minutes, rather than with
                the naming of committee positions.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Grammaticality of Employed Loanwords</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>A direct indicator to the level of English proficiency among the transcribers lies in
                the extent to which the loanwords complied with grammatical conventions and
                relationships, irrespective of the orthography in use. For example, grammatical use of
                the adapted loanword tickets could be <em>le tichette</em>, which provides
                articulation of a gender in the preceding article and agreement in both gender and
                number on the noun form -- two obligatory grammatical features for all nouns in
                Italian. Ungrammatical use of the adapted loanword only occured in two moments in
                which the word <em>dollari</em>, i.e., dollars, broke syntactic conventions and
                appeared at the incorrect point in the sentence, like with the translated sentence
                    <q>to remove dollars 5.00 [from the cashbox]</q>. Additionally, grammatical use
                of an unadapted loanword is found with the English term bills, written occasionally
                as <em>i bills</em>. Here, plurality is indicated in the Italian article, and the
                word itself is also given the English -s inflection, which indicates plurality as
                well on the noun form. An example of ungrammatical use of an unadapted loanword is
                found in the phrase <q>3 tickets</q>, written as <em>3 ticket</em> in the volume. In
                this instance, an -s inflection is also required for agreement in number, but only
                the uninflected form is provided.</p>
            <p>In Figure 3 below, orthographies were not considered, and all loanwords were thus
                considered on the singular property of grammaticality, regardless of whether their
                form was Italian or English. A well-executed use of the loanword in its grammatical
                context, irrespective of orthography, indicates some degree of functional skill with
                English.</p>
        </div>
        <!--#include virtual="ssi/visualizations/grammar.html" -->
        <div class="text">
            <p>Figure 3 measures the presence of loanwords in two different ways. The width of each
                year's bar represents the proportion of total loanwords that appear in a year,
                indicated by the percentage values along the x-axis. The height of each individual
                bar is representative of that specific value's presence within the scope of only
                that year. For example, 1922 accounts for just under 25% of all the loanwords in the
                corpus (as indicated by its width), and grammatical loanwords account for about 10%
                of that proportion. The remainder of all the loanwords in 1922 appeared outside a
                sentential context, which means they were written in isolation from the prose of the
                minutes. This category of loanwords is exclusively titles given to event committee
                members in list form, like <em>chairman of arrangement committee</em> or <em>floor
                    manager</em>, which never occur inside a sentence and are always uninflected.</p>
            <p>Figure 3 puts into perspective the fact that all but the first transcriber relied to
                some extent on the use of loanwords in titles of committee positions, which is of
                little help in evaluating their confidence in writing with loanwords. Conversely,
                one could easily argue that Emilio Marchetti (1921, 1922) exhibited a particularly
                limited and non-functional use of English loanwords, despite the fact that his years
                hold some of the highest loanword counts throughout the seven years.</p>
            <p>It's entirely unclear whether these titles were spoken by the members in Italian and
                translated literally into English, i.e., <em>capo di comitato</em> transcribed as
                    <em>chairman</em>, or if the individuals who spoke at the meetings actually used
                the English terms, i.e., speakers also using the word <em>chairman</em>. In any
                case, Emilio Marchetti showed a striking tendency to employ the English titles in
                those instances, with almost no use of English at other points during his two-year
                period as correspondence secretary.</p>
            <p>Giuseppe Gianni is an interesting individual to track throughout his three-year
                tenure as correspondence secretary, because his linguistic trends during his time
                can be interpreted as a lessening reliance on exhaustively used committee titles and
                a more ambitious attempt to integrate English loanwords into his prose. While he
                does employ a progressively higher number of ungrammatical loanwords between 1923
                and 1925, it could be an expression of his attempt to <q>learn the ropes</q> of
                effectively integrating loanwords in different scenarios.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Distinct Words Used Over the Years</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>The final analysis considered in this research zeroed in on specific terms used
                throughout the duration of the volume of minutes. Figures 4 and 5, below, plot each
                of the terms used by year to glean the variety of words that the transcribers use
                year-by-year. This chart does not discern words of different orthographies; the only
                consideration was the base of the word that found use in a year. Thus, if a word
                were written as <em>le tichette</em> and <em>tickets</em> within the same year,
                those results would be considered simply as <em>ticket</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <!--#include virtual="ssi/visualizations/top-lemma-circle.html" -->
        <div class="text">
            <p>Figure 4 plots all the words that are found <em>at least two different times</em> at
                any point in the corpus. One can see with this graph words that found consistent use
                throughout the seven-year period and also words that appear in greater amounts
                within one year. For instance, the lemma <em>bill</em> appears nine times in the
                seven years, but five of those occurrences fall entirely within the 1924 log, under
                Giuseppe Gianni. Meanwhile, <em>chairman</em> is shown to be a consistently used
                loanword throughout the final six years of the log, appearing seventeen times in
                all and no more than four times in a given year.</p>
            <p><em>Productivity</em>, i.e., the use of one single word in multiple contexts, is a
                key indicator of effective apprenticeship of a language; the reuse of a small
                collection of terms and the isolated use of other words without employing them
                again are both indicators that these men were likely not actively exercising
                knowledge of English. Rather, it seems as though the entire Tuscan League may
                have regularly employed that subset of words reflexively, without a conscious
                intent to actively incorporate more English into their vocabulary. These are
                indicators that English was viewed in a prestigious light among the members of
                the Tuscan League, and that the language's prestige value led them to
                incorporate it into their writing, rather than their functional knowledge of the
                language itself.</p>
