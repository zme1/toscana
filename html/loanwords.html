        <h1>Anglicized Linguistic Conventions in the Lega Toscana</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>While the Tuscan League's records boasted plenty of research opportunity regarding
                member behaviors and relationships, another academically inviting component of the
                corpus included the organizations linguistic conventions -- specifically in their
                use of English loanwords in the volume. As a cultural organization, comprised
                entirely of Tuscan individuals, the Tuscan League unsurprisingly documented the
                meeting's proceedings in Italian. Interestingly, though, the five secretaries who
                transcribed these minutes all used English loanwords to some extent throughout their
                writing. The marked use of English in the volume led to the engagement with this
                corpus at a linguistic level, analyzing when and how English loanwords or words
                derived directly from English were used, and what it may say about the group's
                perceived English proficiency.</p>
            <p>The primary focus on this investigation is to identify how English is embedded into
                the otherwise Italian corpus at the linguistic level. With two exceptions, the words
                are of clear English origin and show unilateral English semantic properties, and a
                study on the manner in which they appear -- which includes their orthography,
                grammatical compliance, level of productivity, and vocabulary -- will help to reveal
                the driving forces that impelled these uses, whether those are linguistic (i.e.
                evidence of English acquisition among members), cultural (i.e. an attempt to
                integrate the English lexicon without presupposing functional English knowledge), or
                a combination of the two.</p>
            <p>Below are various different analyses on how the Tuscans used English within the
                bounds of the minutes. These analyses scrutinised linguistic features of the words
                by observing which words were used, which orthographic system (English or Italian)
                prevailed and when, the productivity of different words in the volume, the context
                in which words were used, and whether the words were used in compliance with
                grammatical conventions. Please continue reading for more detailed information on
                the relationship between the Lega Toscana and their use of English.</p>
