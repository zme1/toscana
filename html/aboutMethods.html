            <h3 class="about">Text digitization and encoding</h3>
            <p>The first of the two digital pillars of the Lega Toscana research project seeked to
                explore the first volume of minutes in its entirety and explore different
                interpersonal and role-based relationships between the members of the Lega
                throughout the minute log. The expression of these relationships in the minutes was
                mostly gathered in a specific series of contexts. Originally, the motivation behind
                this exploring this specific document was to identify relationships and rapport
                established and reinforced by Lega members in the form of meeting proposals (i.e.
                who were the members who made motions during the meeting, and who were the people
                who supported them?), but as the encoding persisted, an interest in committee
                formations, dissemination of funds from the Lega, and activity of members across the
                organization began to surface. By the end of the semester, the research touched on
                each of those subjects, with the use of a handful of different analytical
                programs.</p>
            <h4 class="about">Text Encoding Initiative</h4>
            <p>The entirety of the Lega Toscana's first volume of minutes were uploaded and analyzed
                in a software program called &lt;oXygen/&gt;, which is a textual analysis program
                that implements an extensible markup language to allow for encoded annotations or
                supplemental biographical information on Lega participants for analysis. The markup
                is written to descriptively flag different objects of interest within the text, to
                allow for computation at a later point.</p>
            <p>The specific schema used for development on this project was written in compliance
                with the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org">Text Encoding Initiative</a>, which is an
                open-source collection of different elements, tagging conventions, and document
                types that are optimized for use in the humanities domain. One of the project
                mentors for this portion of research, <a
                    href="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/people/elisa-eileen-beshero-bondar-phd">Elisa
                    Beshero-Bondar</a>, is a member of the TEI Technical Council, the team tasked
                with maintenance and development of the TEI ecosystem. Elements were selected from
                the master list of TEI elements from the TEI All schema set, and customized for
                integration into the Lega minute logs. Specific items that were encoded in the
                minutes included any list of member acceptances or departures, presiding officers,
                proposals of any kind, or grants of funds from the Lega to individual members.
                Additionally, every iterance of an individual's name was tracked throughout the
                minutes as well, which assisted in the codification of individual names in spite of
                a lack of complete documentation on affiliates of the Lega. A sample portion of code
                below shows how proposals were tagged throughout the volume:</p>
            <pre>
  <code>&lt;seg type="proposal" subtype="evento">Fu proposto da &lt;persName ref="#zinim"
     role="proposer">Modesto Zini&lt;/persName> e assecondato da&lt;lb/>
          &lt;persName ref="#marconic" role="supporter">Carlo Marconi&lt;/persName> di dare
          un ballo ma non fu definita&lt;lb/> la data&lt;/seg>
       &lt;list type="committee" subtype="investigazione">
          &lt;date when="1924-10"/>
          &lt;note>Allora &lt;rs ref="#pellegrinic">il presidente&lt;/rs> scielse il seguente
             comitato&lt;lb/> per trovare il locale.&lt;/note>
          &lt;item>&lt;persName ref="#pasquinellis">Santino Pasquinelli&lt;/persName>&lt;roleName
                type="committee" role="investigatore"/>.&lt;/item>
          &lt;item>&lt;persName ref="#marconic">Carlo Marconi&lt;/persName>&lt;roleName
                type="committee" role="investigatore"/>&lt;/item>
          &lt;lb/>
          &lt;item>e &lt;persName ref="#borellim">Martino Borelli&lt;/persName>&lt;roleName
                type="committee" role="investigatore"/>.&lt;/item>
       &lt;/list></code>
            </pre>
            <p>In the code sample above, we show an example of how both <em>proposals</em> and
                    <em>lists</em> are formulated. The participants in proposals were given
                key-value pairs that described the role they had in the proposal, whether it was he
                who made the motion, or he who seconded it. Additionally, the volume contains
                written proposals -- which were always proposed by at least three members -- and
                rejected proposals, which were processed differently than passed proposals (since
                they were not typically met with support by another member). The majority of
                information that was used to process the analyses of member activity and
                relationships in the Lega were mined primarily from different lists that appeared in
                the minutes and proposals. Lists were used to provide information on committee
                formations, officer elections and absences, member acceptances or departures, and
                sometimes member compensation.</p>
            <p>As noted earlier, the TEI All schema contains about 570 total elements, of which only
                20 to 25 typically should appear in a DH project like this. As such, a customized
                    <em>ODD</em>, or "One Document Does it all" file, was drafted to generate and
                enforce customized rules that applied specifically to this project. Additionally,
                another technology named <em>Schematron</em> was employed in the same document,
                which is another schema language that permits further constraint of possible values,
                patterns, and element hierarchies within the encoded document. Both the ODD file and
                the encoded transcription of the minutes are available in full at <a
                    href="http://www.github.com/zme1/toscana">our GitHub repository</a>, along with
                an introductory reading on our <a
                    href="https://github.com/zme1/toscana/wiki/Coding-in-TEI">Wiki page</a>.</p>
            <h4 class="about">Transformations with XSLT</h4>
            <p>When encoding texts with XML, there are other flavors of the XML language that can be
                used for a number of different purposes, from identity or text transformation to
                file conversion to visualization design. The central transformation language that
                was used in this project is XSLT, which wields incredible power in processing texts
                in innumerable ways. XSLT is a file that receives an input file and performs
                transformations according to protocols that are written into the program, and it can
                output the information into a host of different file types. In this specific
                research project, XSLT was used to transform the volume of minutes into other XML
                files that were used for the generation of a personography and data compilation,
                into HTML webpages that contained the Lega minute scans, transcriptions, and
                translations, and into graphic visualizations that help to narrate the different
                trends and traits expressed at the individual and group level in the organization.
                An example of some XSLT code is below.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                  &lt;xsl:template match="TEI">
   &lt;xsl:variable name="date" as="xs:string" select="descendant::publicationStmt/date/@when"/>
   &lt;xsl:variable name="transcription" select="descendant::div[@type = 'transcription']"/>
   &lt;xsl:variable name="translation" select="descendant::div[@type = 'translation']"/>
   &lt;section id="meeting_{$date}">
       &lt;div class="manuscript">
           &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="descendant::pb" mode="img"/>
       &lt;/div>
       &lt;div class="transcription">
           &lt;span class="mainTitle">
               &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="descendant::title[@type = 'main']"/>
           &lt;/span>
           &lt;span class="subTitle">
               &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="descendant::title[@type = 'sub']"/>
           &lt;/span>
           &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="$transcription"/>
       &lt;/div>
       &lt;div class="translation">
           &lt;span class="mainTitle">
               &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="descendant::title[@type = 'main']"/>
           &lt;/span>
           &lt;span class="subTitle">
               &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="descendant::title[@type = 'sub']"/>
           &lt;/span>
           &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="$translation"/>
       &lt;/div>
   &lt;/section>
   &lt;hr class="maj"/>
&lt;/xsl:template>
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>The code snippet above is an example from the XSLT file that tranformed the volume of
                minutes into an HTML reading view of the three different versions that we produced
                for this project -- the scanned images, transcription, and translation. This entire
                file, along with all other XSLT files, is availab on our GitHub page for study.</p>
            <h4 class="about">Social Network Analysis</h4>
            <p>In addition to the XML flavors that were used to analyze the volume of minutes
                quantitatively, the social network analysis program <em>Cytoscape</em> was used as a
                supplemental technology to generate social network graphs that plotted shared
                activity of members, specifically of those who were co-participants in a proposal
                during a meeting. The social networks generated for this research were primarily
                focused on identifying individuals who contributed or supported proposals during the
                meetings, and seeing if there were any notable trends or patterns among those
                members.</p>
            <p>Social network analysis can potentially evoke three separate forms of netowrk
                importance, or centrality, with these computations: Degree centrality, betweenness
                centrality, and closeness centrality. Those three concepts, among other modes of
                network analysis, are explained in more depth in our <a
