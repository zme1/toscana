            <h3>About our Approaches</h3>
            <h4 class="about">Volume Transcription</h4>
            <p>The purpose for the transcription of the notebooks is to reproduce the original in a
                word document in order to facilitate its electronic ease of use. This involved both
                the reproduction of the general organization and structure of each page as well as
                preservation of all spelling (misspellings), punctuation, extraneous
                capitalizations, and any other characteristics of the page in order to render the
                word document as similar as possible to the source text. We followed certain
                transcription guidelines published online by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the
                Smithsonian Institution, and various university library resources, which all
                stressed the importance of reproducing the original document as closely as possible
                in electronic form. We made extensive use of bracketed [tags] to mark parts of the
                text that were either illegible, crossed out, signed, underlined, or appeared in
                between or written over top of the other lines of text, in part to aid with the
                digitization of the texts.</p>
            <h4 class="about">Volume Translation</h4>
            <p>Roughly the first 75 pages of both the transcription and translation were completed
                by students taking an Italian Translation Workshop during the semester of Fall 2017.
                During Spring 2018 that transcription was gone over and corrected, and the existing
                translation, which had been a conglomerate of the different translations of various
                students, was revised and standardized in order to render it more uniform.
                Piggybacking off the work of last semester, the transcription and translation were
                completed through the end of the first volume of meeting minutes, which span from
                1919 through 1925. Work on the second volume of minutes, spanning 1933 through 1940,
                is currently underway.</p>
            <p>The use of a formal and repetitive language and tone in each meeting throughout the
                entire first notebook prompted the use of a similarly formulaic language within the
                English translation. We felt that the use of meeting-specific phraseology (e.g. “the
                meeting is adjourned” rather than “the meeting is ended”) was appropriate in this
                situation. Apart from these instances, the translation aimed at maintaining wording
                and general sentence structure except in places where doing so would threaten the
                clarity of the translation, in which case the English analogues of certain
                figurative phrases were employed.</p>
            <p>Beyond the translation alone, the process involved the standardization of many
                commonly used words and phrases to ensure that things were translated in a similar
                manner throughout the entire volume of minutes. In order to maximize the
                comprehensibility of the translation, correct spelling, capitalization, and
                punctuation was used for instances where they were incorrect in the source text. We
                also felt it would be helpful to have the lines in the translation correspond, if
                somewhat loosely at points, to those in the transcription, so that it would be
                easier to navigate between the two documents, thus increasing their ease of use as a
                tandem resource as well as increasing their accessibility to those beyond the
                Italian-speaking community.</p>
            <p>We found it especially helpful to create supplementary documents to help us keep
                track of certain things throughout this entire process. This includes a list of
                commonly used words and phrases, as previously mentioned, an Index of Names, which
                can be used to find instances where people were mentioned within the minutes, and an
                Index of Places encountered in the documents with their corresponding addresses when
                available.</p>
            <h3 class="about">Text digitization and encoding</h3>
            <p>The first of the two digital pillars of the Lega Toscana research project seeked to
                explore the first volume of minutes in its entirety and explore different
                interpersonal and role-based relationships between the members of the Lega
                throughout the minute log. The expression of these relationships in the minutes was
                mostly gathered in a specific series of contexts. Originally, the motivation behind
                this exploring this specific document was to identify relationships and rapport
                established and reinforced by Lega members in the form of meeting proposals (i.e.
                who were the members who made motions during the meeting, and who were the people
                who supported them?), but as the encoding persisted, an interest in committee
                formations, dissemination of funds from the Lega, and activity of members across the
                organization began to surface. By the end of the semester, the research touched on
                each of those subjects, with the use of a handful of different analytical
                programs.</p>
            <h4 class="about">Text Encoding Initiative</h4>
            <p>The entirety of the Lega Toscana's first volume of minutes were uploaded and analyzed
                in a software program called &lt;oXygen/&gt;, which is a textual analysis program
                that implements an extensible markup language to allow for encoded annotations or
                supplemental biographical information on Lega participants for analysis. The markup
                is written to descriptively flag different objects of interest within the text, to
                allow for computation at a later point.</p>
            <p>The specific schema used for development on this project was written in compliance
                with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tei-c.org">Text Encoding
                Initiative</a>, which is an open-source collection of different elements, tagging
                conventions, and document types that are optimized for use in the humanities domain.
                One of the project mentors for this portion of research, <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/people/elisa-eileen-beshero-bondar-phd">Elisa
                    Beshero-Bondar</a>, is a member of the TEI Technical Council, the team tasked
                with maintenance and development of the TEI ecosystem. Elements were selected from
                the master list of TEI elements from the TEI All schema set, and customized for
                integration into the Lega minute logs. Specific items that were encoded in the
                minutes included any list of member acceptances or departures, presiding officers,
                proposals of any kind, or grants of funds from the Lega to individual members.
                Additionally, every iterance of an individual's name was tracked throughout the
                minutes as well, which assisted in the codification of individual names in spite of
                a lack of complete documentation on affiliates of the Lega. A sample portion of code
                below shows how proposals were tagged throughout the volume:</p>
            <pre>
  <code>&lt;seg type="proposal" subtype="evento">Fu proposto da &lt;persName ref="#zinim"
     role="proposer">Modesto Zini&lt;/persName> e assecondato da&lt;lb/>
          &lt;persName ref="#marconic" role="supporter">Carlo Marconi&lt;/persName> di dare
          un ballo ma non fu definita&lt;lb/> la data&lt;/seg>
       &lt;list type="committee" subtype="investigazione">
          &lt;date when="1924-10"/>
          &lt;note>Allora &lt;rs ref="#pellegrinic">il presidente&lt;/rs> scielse il seguente
             comitato&lt;lb/> per trovare il locale.&lt;/note>
          &lt;item>&lt;persName ref="#pasquinellis">Santino Pasquinelli&lt;/persName>&lt;roleName
                type="committee" role="investigatore"/>.&lt;/item>
          &lt;item>&lt;persName ref="#marconic">Carlo Marconi&lt;/persName>&lt;roleName
                type="committee" role="investigatore"/>&lt;/item>
          &lt;lb/>
          &lt;item>e &lt;persName ref="#borellim">Martino Borelli&lt;/persName>&lt;roleName
                type="committee" role="investigatore"/>.&lt;/item>
       &lt;/list></code>
            </pre>
            <p>In the code sample above, we show an example of how both <em>proposals</em> and
                    <em>lists</em> are formulated. The participants in proposals were given
                key-value pairs that described the role they had in the proposal, whether it was he
                who made the motion, or he who seconded it. Additionally, the volume contains
                written proposals -- which were always proposed by at least three members -- and
                rejected proposals, which were processed differently than passed proposals (since
                they were not typically met with support by another member). The majority of
                information that was used to process the analyses of member activity and
                relationships in the Lega were mined primarily from different lists that appeared in
                the minutes and proposals. Lists were used to provide information on committee
                formations, officer elections and absences, member acceptances or departures, and
                sometimes member compensation.</p>
            <p>As noted earlier, the TEI All schema contains about 570 total elements, of which only
                20 to 25 typically should appear in a DH project like this. As such, a customized
                    <em>ODD</em>, or "One Document Does it all" file, was drafted to generate and
                enforce customized rules that applied specifically to this project. Additionally,
                another technology named <em>Schematron</em> was employed in the same document,
                which is another schema language that permits further constraint of possible values,
                patterns, and element hierarchies within the encoded document. Both the ODD file and
                the encoded transcription of the minutes are available in full at <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.github.com/zme1/toscana">our GitHub repository</a>, along with
                an introductory reading on our <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://github.com/zme1/toscana/wiki/Coding-in-TEI">Wiki page</a>.</p>
            <h4 class="about">Transformations with XSLT</h4>
            <p>When encoding texts with XML, there are other flavors of the XML language that can be
                used for a number of different purposes, from identity or text transformation to
                file conversion to visualization design. The central transformation language that
                was used in this project is XSLT, which can effectively process files a number of
                ways. XSLT is a file that receives an input file and performs transformations
                according to templates that are written into the program, and it can output the
                information into a host of different file types. In this specific research project,
                XSLT was used to transform the volume of minutes into other XML files that were used
                for the generation of a personography and data compilation, into HTML webpages that
                contained the Lega minute scans, transcriptions, and translations, and into graphic
                visualizations that help to narrate the different trends and traits expressed at the
                individual and group level in the organization. An example of some XSLT code is
                below.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                  &lt;xsl:template match="TEI">
   &lt;xsl:variable name="date" as="xs:string" select="descendant::publicationStmt/date/@when"/>
   &lt;xsl:variable name="transcription" select="descendant::div[@type = 'transcription']"/>
   &lt;xsl:variable name="translation" select="descendant::div[@type = 'translation']"/>
   &lt;section id="meeting_{$date}">
       &lt;div class="manuscript">
           &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="descendant::pb" mode="img"/>
       &lt;/div>
       &lt;div class="transcription">
           &lt;span class="mainTitle">
               &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="descendant::title[@type = 'main']"/>
           &lt;/span>
           &lt;span class="subTitle">
               &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="descendant::title[@type = 'sub']"/>
           &lt;/span>
           &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="$transcription"/>
       &lt;/div>
       &lt;div class="translation">
           &lt;span class="mainTitle">
               &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="descendant::title[@type = 'main']"/>
           &lt;/span>
           &lt;span class="subTitle">
               &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="descendant::title[@type = 'sub']"/>
           &lt;/span>
           &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="$translation"/>
       &lt;/div>
   &lt;/section>
   &lt;hr class="maj"/>
&lt;/xsl:template>
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>The code snippet above is an example from the XSLT file that tranformed the volume of
                minutes into an HTML reading view of the three different versions that we produced
                for this project -- the scanned images, transcription, and translation. This entire
                file, along with all other XSLT files, is availab on our GitHub page for study.</p>
            <h4 class="about">Social Network Analysis</h4>
            <p>In addition to the XML flavors that were used to analyze the volume of minutes
                quantitatively, the social network analysis program <em>Cytoscape</em> was used as a
                supplemental technology to generate social network graphs that plotted shared
                activity of members, specifically of those who were co-participants in a proposal
                during a meeting. The social networks generated for this research were primarily
                focused on identifying individuals who contributed or supported proposals during the
                meetings, and seeing if there were any notable trends or patterns among those
                members.</p>
            <p>Social network analysis can potentially evoke three separate forms of netowrk
                importance, or centrality, with these computations: Degree centrality, betweenness
                centrality, and closeness centrality. Those three concepts, among other modes of
                network analysis, are explained in more depth in our <a
                    href="keyMembers.html#social">Key Members</a> webpage.</p>

            <h3>Spatial Mapping</h3>
            <p>Rita Keil mapped the Tuscan League community in the software ArcMap using the skills
                she gained pursuing the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) certificate at the
                University of Pittsburgh. The purpose of these maps is to reveal where Tuscan League
                community members lived and worked, and how that changed over time.</p>
            <p>First Rita assembled a database of about 400 street addresses, people and business
                names, and notes mentioned in the League's meeting minutes, applications to the
                Women's Auxiliary of the League, and Eliza's biographical research. She then created
                a geocoder which matched addresses in the database to spatial locations using street
                and address boundary data available on the Allegheny County GIS Database. The
                geocoder matched about 80% of the addresses. The remaining addresses had to be
                manually corrected for reasons like the spelling of the street had changed over time
                or the street address no longer existed. This was especially true for many addresses
                in the Hill District as it nears Downtown, where Wylie and Webster Avenues were
                truncated in the 1960s in order to build I-579. Those addresses were matched based
                on 1903 maps of Downtown published on the Historic Pittsburgh website.</p>
            <p>With all of the data points imported, Rita symbolized the residential locations by
                color and decade to see temporal patterns in residence location. Rita also added a
                neighborhood layer from the Allegheny County GIS Database to the map and labeled
                only neighborhoods within 0.2 miles of a residential or commercial point, to see
                which neighborhoods were most important to the community. Lastly, Rita analyzed the
                map using the ArcMap Spatial Analyst Point Density tool to visualize where
                residential points were most tightly clustered.</p>
            <p>This map could be expanded upon by adding data from earlier time points that may show
                more of a migration from Downtown and the Hill District to the South Hills. There
                are historic reports of Italian - American communities Downtown and on the Hill, but
                location data is not yet available.</p>
            <h3>Lega Family Research</h3>
            <p>Eliza Jermyn was responsible for creating biographies for the most active members of
                the Tuscan League. In order to begin her research on the men, Eliza used an Index
                that the group had created in the Fall. This index highlighted each time a certain
                person was mentioned. The men with the most mentions were the most active. These men
                included Casimiro Pellegrini, Muzio Frediani, Stefano Maffei, Emilio Marchetti,
                Michele Simonetti, Santino Pasquinelli, Americo Pasquinelli and Modesto Zini.
                Utilizing online databases like <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://historicpittsburgh.org/">Historic Pittsburgh</a>, Ancestry,
                Newspapers and Family Search, she collected evidence through primary sources like
                censuses, draft registration, death certificates and newspaper articles.</p>
            <p>Working with one family at a time, Eliza created an outline of information based on
                the evidence she had collected. Some people, like Emilio Marchetti and Michele
                Simonetti, were very active in the Lega Toscana but not in the Pittsburgh community,
                according to the primary sources. After organizing the knowledge she had of each
                man, Eliza wrote biographical summaries. Beginning with each man’s date of
                immigration and occupation, she moved into a description of their social activity in
                Pittsburgh and then ended on a description of their activity within the Lega, which
                can be seen in a different format on Zachary’s social networks and activity heat
                map.</p>
