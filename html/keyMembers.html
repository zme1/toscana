      <h1>Key Members in the Lega Toscana</h1>
      <div class="text">
         <p><em>La Lega Toscana di Protezione</em> was an organization that provided an substantial
            amount of financial, social, and cultural support to all its members, of which there
            were 239 recorded in the first volume of minutes. The organization itself held events
            like dances, picnics, and private parties; gave generously to individuals in the League
            and other members of the Italian community, both locally and abroad; and supported a
            nucleus of Tuscan immigrants who had found a home in the Pittsburgh area.</p>
         <p>In the seven years recorded in the volume of minutes under our scrutiny, the Tuscan
            League proved to be a truly instrumental component of the local Italians, and the
            primary interest in this portion of the research was to identify the trajectory of the
            League's role with its members, and how that role took shape through the span of time.
            Particularly, the underlying motivation behind this research was, <q>Who was the
                  <em>Lega Toscana</em>, and whom did they impact?</q> In exploring the former, we
            wanted to tease out the organization's influential and impacting individuals, and in
            exploring the latter, we wanted to begin to understand the extent of this group's reach
            into the local Italian community.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Flow of Members Throughout the Years</h2>
      <div class="text">
         <p>There were 239 total individuals named throughout this first span of seven years, but
            the number of full members varied, at least slightly, through time. While not all the
            membership records in the volume are taken as absolute truth, we were able to identify
            general trends in membership through the recording of member acceptances and departures
            noted in the meeting minutes. Although there were at least some members who came and
            went silently throughout these years (most of whom travelled back to Italy for varied
            periods of time), the majority of official changes in membership status were documented
            during meetings. Unfortunately, the aggregated information on member flow is not
            available, since members were known to silently take leaves of absence for undetermined
            amounts of time. That said, there are still distinct patterns in the League's membership
            that are worth our attention. Figure 1 is a bar graph visualization that juxtaposes the two
            changes in membership status, acceptances and departures, throughout the volume.</p>

      </div>
      <!--#include virtual="ssi/visualizations/cancellatiAccettati_verticalBar.html" -->
      <div class="text">
         <p>As seen in Figure 1, the Tuscan League saw a few distinct trends in regards to changes in
            membership status, in both positive and in negative ways. In the first three years of
            our recorded minutes, while the League was still rather young, the proportion of
            incoming to outgoing members was distinctly positive. Even in light of the loss of 17
            members in 1919, member retention was ostensibly rather strong, with over 75 new members
            officially earning their membership. However, beginning in 1922, the trend began to see
            its first sharp change in trend; the organization saw neither many incoming or outgoing
            members in 1922. In 1923 and 1924, the League seemed to slip on its ability to
            effectively retain a consistent population. In the minute logs, the years between 1922
            and 1924 are speckled with moments where the president or another officer discuss the
            need to uphold or improve morale in the organization. Although it's mentioned nowhere in
            the manuscript, the subtext suggests that the downward turn in memberships, sinking
            morale, and intermittent trips taken by members to Italy could have been influenced, at
            least in part, by the ascent of Fascism in Italy, which came to full fruition in March
            of 1922 when Benito Mussolini marched on Rome and assumed political control of the
            nation under the National Fascist Party. Then, 1925 sees a drastic turn in the
            membership statistics, with 65 members accepted into the League, and zero members taking
            their leave. Michele Simonetti, one of the most consistently influential members of the
            League in the scope of this volume, brought a veteran member's experience to the
            administration and seemed to have been driven to counteract the festering problem
            surrounding member retention.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Sick Compensation to Lega Members</h2>
      <div class="text">
         <p> One of the primary functions of the Tuscan Protection League as evidenced in the
            minutes was a means of some level of financial security for its members, both as a type
            of welfare service for active members who fall ill and are ostensibly too unwell to
            work, and as a source of financial assistance for funerary costs of deceased members. Of
            the two, the former was a much more common occurence within the bounds of the minutes,
            while the latter did account for four different transactions between the Tuscan League
            and family of deceased members, which amounted to about $600. While there were other
            forms of payment given to members in the form of reimbursement for purchase of goods for
            the group or for a group-sponsored event, or even, as the later years show, as a stipend
            to individuals who serve on the executive board, this particular graph focuses only on
            sick compensation to members of the Lega Toscana.</p>
      </div>
      <!--#include virtual="ssi/visualizations/sickComp_line.html" -->
      <div class="text">
         <p>One of the most notable conditions in the application process of a new member was the
            presentation of a certification of good health by a medical doctor, which was then
            verified by the Health Officers, who were responsible for ensuring that all the
            requisites for membership were met regarding individual health. While specifics
            regarding these requisites were never explicated in the minutes, this medical clearance
            likely played such a substantial role because of the offered welfare stipends for unwell
            members. The parameters regarding these compensations were never deliberated until 1921,
            a year in which five members all received over $50 in compensation. In December of that
            year, Michele Simonetti was awarded $56 in for a surgical procedure. After that point,
            the decided maximum compensation amount permitted at one time was $50. However, the
            fluid and circumstantial governance of the Lega comes into view when both Enrico
            Sandroni and Benedetto Pardini are both granted $60 in sick compensation in 1925. While
            the Lega Toscana had policies set in place for a number of issues, of which maximum
            compensations were one, the organization showed either a willful decision to forego the
            policy, or (since the larger sums were granted years after the policy was put into
            effect) the Lega could have simply forgotten about them.</p>
         <p>Figure 2 is a line graph visualization that shows the outward flow of money to members
            <em>for sick compensation only</em>. Given the time constraints of this research, the
            organization's use of its finances could not be more closely scrutinized.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Member Activity in the Lega</h2>
      <div class="text">
         <p>Member activity, in a general sense, was the component of the research that permitted
            the highest potential of exploration. Across the entire Tuscan League, of which there
            were 239 people identified as members throughout the years, those who showed agency in
            the context of the volume of minutes is much smaller. Less than 50% of the 239 members
            -- 114, to be exact -- were truly considered <q>active</q> members at least for one
            moment in time in the organization. The parameters that were set to define member agency
            were rather rigid; only those who were evidenced to have served on a committee,
            participated in a proposal, served as an officer, or received money from or gave money
            to the Lega were considered as active members. With these considerations in place, just
            under 50% of the individuals in the organization participated within the bounds of the
            minutes volume.</p>
         <p>The League's primary expenditure of energy was oriented in the events that they held,
            both annual and special events. Every year, they organized a summer picnic and winter
            ball, both of which were exhaustively planned beforehand with committees that included
            dozens of members at a time. The minutes reveal that these were well-attended events as
            well, with a formidable turnout of the League's members. Even though many did not
            participate regularly in the monthly precedings, the large summer and winter events were
            extremely popular for all affiliates of the Tuscan League. Other committees included
               <em>regolamento</em> committees, which were reponsible for revisiting or revising
            current organizational policies; <em>investigazione</em> committees, which were charged
            with exploratory or investigative work that preceded an event (like finding locales or
            drafting committee timelines); other event-based committees like the <em>banchetto</em>
            or <em>intrattenimento</em> committees, which either planned small celebrations or
            evening socials; with other committees that were formed to fulfill a specific purpose
            then disbanded, like the <em>parata</em> (Columbus Day parade) committee or the
               <em>stendardo</em> (League flag and banner) committee. Some of these committees, like
            the <em>regolamento</em> and <em>investigazione</em>, were always disbanded after a
            month, while most of the other committees met for at least two months before
            dissolving.</p>
         <p>Figure 3 just below is a heatmap that shows the distribution of member activity
            across the span of time. The columns each represent one individual who, at any point in
            the volume, recorded at least one <q>unit</q> of activity -- that is, an individual who
            served on a committee, participated in a proposal, gave or received money, or acted as
            an officer at any single point in time. As is the case with a conventional heat map, the
            darker the color of the cell, the more active a member was on that given date.
               <strong>Note that the black lines that surround a given table cell indicate that the
               person in question was an officer at that point in time.</strong></p>
         <p style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 125%;"><em>Note</em>: In clicking on a table cell
            inside the heat map, the member and activity information will appear in the table that
            sits just below the graph. The name of each member is their full last name, followed
            immediately by one to three of the first letters of their first name.</p>

      <div class="text">
         <p>Where Figure 3 excels in aggregation of member activity across the span of time among
            all members, it lacks in its ability to juxtapose the activity between years. And while
            it's clear that officers comprise the vast majority of member activity, it's difficult
            to quantify the difference with any degree of certainty, being that the information is
            member-centric. Figure 4, thus, reframes the same information through a different
            lens. This stacked bar graph represents member activity by year, with the general member
            activity being recorded in red, and officer activity in blue. The numbers that appear in
            each segment are the raw counts of different units of activity to allow quick and easy
            comparison between the two groups. Additionally, all of the bar widths add to 100% of
            total activity, but varied degrees of total activity in a year are expressed in the
            dynamic widths of the bars. Please refer to the legend below the graph as a guide to
            understand the graph.</p>
      </div>
      <!--#include virtual="ssi/visualizations/activity_stacked.html" -->
      <div class="text">
         <p>The true dynamic of member activity across the entire Tuscan League is made most
            apparent in this stacked bar graph. The League, a society of almost 240 recorded
            individual members, was maintained in major part by a nucleus of ten to fourteen
            officers in a given year. In every single recorded year, officer activity amounted to
            well over 50% of total organizational activity, with two years surpassing 70%! In the
            majority of analyses run for this research, 1921 seems to have a consistently impressive
            presence, and, as seen above it's the year that sees the most activity across all
            members, and also the greatest partition of activity between general members and
            officers.</p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="social">Networks of Interactions</h2>
      <div class="text">
         <p> While the visualizations discussed above mostly orient a focus toward group behaviors
            or statistics, the social networks generated for this project are rigidly oriented
            toward a specific expression of an individual's contributions to the Lega Toscana. The
            chief goal in producing social networks for the Tuscan League is to evoke potential
            relationships between members, or to identify individuals who accrued social clout
            through the proposals they made. Understanding who spoke with whom can help to unearth
            the more nuanced relationships of those in the organization.</p>
         <p>Firuges 5, 6, and 7 below are member social networks -- visual depictions of shared interactions during meetings,
            namely between those who participated in proposals. The volume itself contained several
            distinct types of proposals, but in the interest of strictly visualizing shared
            interactions between individual members, only conventional proposals that were passed by
            the General Assembly were considered for use in these images. These conventional
            proposals were always made by one member and supported by either one or two other
            members.</p>
         <p>The networks themselves have several different informational components that amount to a
            composite picture of the proposals made during the seven-year log. While most of
            these are self-explicit, one deserves clarification. The individuals are represented by
               <em>nodes</em>, or circles, and the proposals are represented by <em>edges</em>, or
            lines. These networks are <strong>force-directed</strong>, which is to say there is a
               <em>source node</em> and a <em>target node</em>. In other words, the interaction
            begins with one person and ends with another, instead of the interaction passing
            equally through both parties, like a casual conversation would.</p>
         <p><strong>The <q>force</q>, or direction, considered in these networks is one that flows from the supporter to
               the proposer, rather than the other way around</strong>. Intuitively, the propsal's
            source would be he who proposed it, but we displayed the inverse to more readily
            identify those who actually make the proposals. The support received from different
            members in the Lega can be seen as a type of social credit, and the more proposals made
            by an individual that are met with support, the more influence a person may have had in
            the Tuscan League's monthly proceedings.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Proposal Social Networks</h3>
      <h4 class="cyto">Figure 5</h4>
      <img class="social" src="../cytoscape_viz/output/seg_proposal_output.png" alt="soc-network" />
      <div class="text">
         <p>Figure 5 comprises the entirety of all the approved proposals made during the
            seven-year period in the volume of minutes. Immediately, several members can be
            identified as central to the network as a whole. Of all those who participated in a
            proposal at any point, Stefano Maffei and Modesto Zini are the most well-represented,
            with 34 and 33 proposals each, respectively.</p>
      </div>
      <h4 class="cyto">Figure 6</h4>
      <img class="social" src="../cytoscape_viz/output/maffeis_output.png" alt="soc-network" />
      <div class="text">
         <p>In contrast, Figure 6 is a <em>subnetwork</em> that includes only Stefano Maffei and all
            those with whom he interacted in a proposal. Stefano Maffei has the highest degree
            centrality of all the individuals in the entire network. <em>Degree centrality</em> is
            the most intuitive measure of influence in a network. The more connections a single node
            has, the higher its degree centrality. There are two other types of centrality that are
            commonly measured with social networks, <em>closeness centrality</em> and
            <em>betweenness centrality</em>. Closeness centrality is an expression of network
            importance based on how quickly one node can access all other nodes in the entire
            network. In other words, Stefano Maffei's node can most quickly step to every other node
            in the whole network, being that his direct connections are the most prolific and his
            secondary connections are also well integrated into the network. Betweenness centrality
            is a measure of the number of different subnetworks that one node can access directly,
            and again, since Stefano Maffei is so disproportionately central to the culture of
            proposals in the Tuscan League, he is considered to be a central gatekeeper of the
            other, much smaller, subnetworks in this visualization.</p>
      </div>
      <h4 class="cyto">Figure 7</h4>
      <img class="social" src="../cytoscape_viz/output/zinim_output.png" alt="soc-network" />
      <div class="text">
         <p>The third and final social network visualization is the subnetwork for Modesto Zini.
            Modesto Zini is a person of particular interest in this research, for he defies the
            conventional behavioral patterns for an individual of his standing in the Lega. He is
            only an elected officer for one year, yet he is shown to be consistently and
            substantially active as a member throughout the seven-year period. He is involved with
            33 proposals, and his subnetwork also displays him with all his adjacent neighbors.
            Unlike Stefano Maffei, however, Modesto Zini has a richer variety of immediate
            connections, which include both members who tended to serve as officers, and others who
            did not. Stefano Maffei's network is much more closely connected with officers, and
            Modesto Zini seems to effectively straddle the line between officers and general
            members. While, statistically speaking, Stefano Maffei has the most social clout, it's
            well worth noting that Modesto Zini has a particularly healthy network of immediate
            connections in this proposal network, as evidenced by his numerous connections with
            smaller, less globally influential nodes in the network.</p>
