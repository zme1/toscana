         <p>The Lega Toscana di Protezione was an organization that provided an substantial amount
            of financial, social, and cultural support to all its members, of which there were 239
            recorded in the first volume of minutes. The organization itself held events like
            dances, picnics, and private parties; gave generously to individuals in the Lega and
            other members of the Italian community, both locally and abroad; and supported a nucleus
            of Tuscan immigrants who had found a home in the Pittsburgh area.</p>
         <p>In the seven years recorded in the volume of minutes under our scrutiny, the Lega
            Toscana proved to be a truly instrumental component of the local Italians, and the
            primary interest in this portion of the research was to identify the trajectory of the
            Lega's role with its members, and how that role took shape through the span of time.
            Particularly, the underlying motivation behind this research was, "Who was the Lega
            Toscana, and whom did they impact?" In exploring the former, we wanted to tease out the
            Lega's influential and impacting individuals, and in exploring the latter, we wanted to
            begin to understand the extent of this group's reach into the local Italian
            community.</p>

      <h3>Flow of Members Throughout the Years</h3>
      <div class="text">
         <p>There were 239 total individuals named throughout this first span of seven years, but
            the number of full members varied, at least slightly, through time. While not all the
            membership records in the volume are taken as absolute truth, we were able to identify
            general trends in membership through the recording of member acceptances and departures
            noted in the meeting minutes. Although there were at least some members who came and
            went silently throughout these years (most of whom travelled back to Italy for varied
            periods of time), the majority of official changes in membership status were documented
            during meetings. Unfortunately, the aggregated information on member flow is not
            available, since members were known to take leaves of absence for undetermined amounts
            of time. That said, there are still distinct patterns in the Lega memberships that are
            worth our attention. Below is a bar graph visualization that juxtaposes the two changes
            in membership status, acceptance and departure, throughout the volume.</p>

      <div class="text">
         <p>As seen above, the Lega saw a few distinct trends in regards to changes in membership
            status, in both positive and in negative ways. In the first three years of our recorded
            minutes, while the Lega was still rather young, the proportion of incoming to outgoing
            members was distinctly positive. Even in light of the loss of 17 members in 1919, member
            retention was ostensibly rather strong, with over 75 new members officially earning
            their membership. However, beginning in 1922, the trend began to see its first sharp
            change in trend; the Lega saw neither many incoming or outgoing members in 1922. In 1923
            and 1924, the Lega seemed to slip on its ability to effectively retain a consistent
            population. In the minute logs, the years between 1922 and 1924 are speckled with
            moments where the president or another officer discuss the need to uphold or improve
            morale in the organization. Although it's mentioned nowhere in the manuscript, the
            subtext suggests that the downward turn in memberships, sinking morale, and intermittent
            trips taken by members to Italy could have been influenced at least partly by the ascent
            of fascism in Italy, which came to full fruition in March of 1922 when Benito Mussolini.
            Then, 1925 sees a drastic turn in the membership statistics, with 65 members accepted
            into the Lega, and zero members taking their leave. Michele Simonetti, one of the most
            consistently influential members of the Lega in the scope of this volume, brought a
            veteran member's experience to the administration and seemed to have been driven to
            counteract the festering problem surrounding member retention.</p>

      <h3>Sick Compensation to Lega Members</h3>
      <div class="text">
         <p> One of the primary functions of the Lega Toscana as evidenced in the minutes was a
            means of some level of financial security for its members, both as a type of welfare
            service for active members who fall ill and are ostensibly too unwell to work, and as a
            source of financial assistance for funerary costs of deceased Lega members. Of the two,
            the former was a much more common occurence within the bounds of the minutes, while the
            latter did account for four different transactions between the Lega and family of
            deceased members, which amounted to about $600. While there were other forms of payment
            given to members in the form of reimbursement for purchase of goods for the group or for
            a group-sponsored event, or even, as the later years show, as a stipend to individuals
            who serve on the executive board, this particular graph focuses only on sick
            compensation to members of the Lega Toscana.</p>
         <p>One of the most notable conditions in the application process of a new member was the
            presentation of a certification of good health by a medical doctor, which was then
            verified by the Health Officers, who were responsible for ensuring that all the
            requisites for membership were met regarding individual health. While specifics
            regarding these requisites were never explicated in the minutes, this medical clearance
            likely played such a substantial role because of the offered welfare stipends for unwell
            members. The parameters regarding these compensations were never deliberated until 1921,
            a year in which five members all received over $50 in compensation. In December of that
            year, Michele Simonetti was awarded $56 in for a surgical procedure. After that point,
            the decided maximum compensation amount permitted at one time was $50. However, the
            fluid and circumstantial governance of the Lega comes into view when both Enrico
            Sandroni and Benedetto Pardini are both granted $60 in sick compensation in 1925. While
            the Lega Toscana had policies set in place for a number of issues, of which maximum
            compensations were one, the organization showed either a willful decision to forego the
            policy, or (since the larger sums were granted years after the policy was put into
            effect) the Lega could have simply forgot about them.</p>
         <p>Below is a line graph visualization that shows the outward flow of money to members
               <em>for sick compensation only</em>. Given the time constraints of this research, the
            finances could not be more closely scrutinized in the given time frame.</p>
