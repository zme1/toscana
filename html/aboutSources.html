            <h4>Our Collaborators</h4>
            <p>This project, being multi-faceted and containing research from several specialties
                and academic domains, deeply thanks all the individuals and groups who personally
                contributed to development on the project. With students and faculty from multiple
                campuses all graciously investing their energy in this project, it's impossible to
                imagine that this project would have developed to the point it's at now.</p>
            <p>Being that the Lega materials that we studied throughout this semester were a primary
                pedagogical resource for Dr. Insana and her translation workshop students in the
                fall of 2017, we are happy to thank the students from that class for the continued
                work that they developed in transcribing and translating the first 75 pages of the
                first volume of Lega minutes. The student participants who contributed to the
                initial linguistic study of these documents are the following: Jenna Bernadino,
                Jordan Brewer, Jessica Cappellini, Zachary Enick, Maria Fenner, Eliza Jermyn, Rita
                Keil, Luke Langkamp, Kaleigh Mauroni, Archie Millar, Henry Novara, and Calvin
                Salazar. Of that group of students, Zachary, Eliza, Rita, and Archie were the four
                who decided to continue their own personal research projects on the Lega
                Toscana after their first exposure to them in the classroom.</p>
            <p>Elisa Beshero-Bondar is an associate professor of English at the University of
                Pittsburgh, Greensburg campus. Elisa serves as the sponsor for the Greensburg
                chapter of <a href="http://www.english.org/sigmatd/">Sigma Tau Delta</a> and as the
                director of Greensburg's <a
                    href="http://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/digital-humanities/center-digital-text"
                    >Center for Digital Texts</a>. Additionally, Elisa is a chair member of the <a
                    href="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Council/">TEI Technical Council</a>, an
                eleven-person team that maintains and continues development of the TEI ecosystem.
                Elisa volunteered her expertise in text-encoding and TEI compliance and was the
                chief mentor for the portion of the project on social mapping of the members of the
                Lega. Additionally, Elisa facilitated an online collaboration of student digital
                humanists from the greater Pittsburgh area and abroad, all of whom comprised a
                weekly web conference to discuss new ditigal technologies and to develop individual
                DH projects.</p>
            <p>David J. Birnbaum is a professor and co-chair of the Department of Slavic Languages
                and Literature at the University of Pittsburgh. As a digital humanist, David is an
                internationally renowned specialist in electronic text processing. Along with Elisa
                Beshero-Bondar, he contributed personally in the development of the social mapping
                of the Lega members.</p>
            <p>While the work for the spatial map was completed, for the most part, independently
                and under loose guidance, we thank the faculty from the Geology department at the
                University of Pittsburgh for the mentorship given to student researchers throughout
                the development of the geographical maps of Lega Residences. You can read more about
                the Geology departments GIS Studies certificate program <a

            <h4>Our Online Sources</h4>
            <p>The online resources used for this project were a collection of free and paid
                sources, including some geneological websites, archived newspaper articles, and
                more, and they were used to compile the biological profiles of each of families that
                are discussed in our <a href="families.html">About the Lega</a> webpage. An itemized
                list of all the online resources and articles consulted for this project are listed
                below, organized by family.</p>
