            <h4>The Heinz History Center</h4>
            <p>Founded in 1990, the Senator John Heinz History Center's Italian American Program is
                dedicated to preserving and interpreting the history and culture of Italian
                Americans in Western Pennsylvania through exhibitions, educational programs,
                publications, and community outreach. For nearly three decades, it has documented
                the pivotal role Italian Americans play in shaping the region's political, economic,
                religious, and cultural landscapes. The Italian American Collection is one of the
                largest repositories of Italian American material culture in the United States. This
                specialized collection houses approximately 800 objects, including textiles,
                utensils, tools, sculptures, housewares, and other three-dimensional items, and
                thousands of archival records in the form of books, photographs, immigration
                materials, family papers, records from mutual beneficial societies and fraternal
                organizations, and oral histories from more than 300 first, second, and third
                generation Italian Americans from Western Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>Among the many Italian immigrant communities documented by the Italian American
                Program, the Tuscans of Pittsburgh are among the most well represented thanks to the
                records of the <em>Lega Toscana di Protezione</em>, donated by Laura Baccelli
                Vondas-Vizzuto. The collection, housed in the History Center's Detre Library &amp;
                Archives, is one of the most complete assortment of records from an Italian lodge,
                containing minutes, membership information, and financial records from the men's
                organization and the Ladies' Auxiliary. Besides the Lega records, oral histories
                from restauranteurs John and Nino Barsotti and Bruno Tambellini shed a light on the
                both the social and business practices of the Lucchesi; photographic collections
                from Tambellini's on Seventh Street, Tambellini's in the North Hills, and
                Tambellini's in Bridgeville illustrate three of the eleven Tambellini's restaurants
                that once populated the Pittsburgh metro area. Some of the artifacts representing
                the local Tuscan community in the collection are an espresso machine from Poli's
                Restaurant, a fryer basket used to make fried zucchini from Tambellini's Ristorante
                on Seventh Street, bottles from Roma Bottling Works, Prohibition-era bottles of
                Tambellini's China Celli Elixir, and fiberglass murals of the Walls of Lucca and
                Puccini-inspired vignettes by artist Ivo Zini.</p>
            <p>Melissa E. Marinaro is the Director of the Italian American Program at the Senator
                John Heinz History Center where she oversees the institution's Italian American
                Collection and manages the Italian American Program's public and educational
                programming, community outreach, and Italian American Advisory Council. Marinaro has
                a BFA in Photography from Columbia College Chicago and a MA in Art History with a
                concentration in the History of Photography from Savannah College of Art and Design.
                She has worked at <em>The Art Institute of Chicago</em> in Museum Education, <em>The
                    Chicago History Museum</em> in Special Collections, and was the Interim Director
                of Education at <em>Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art</em>. In 2009,
                she co-founded a small commercial art gallery and project space in Chicago with two
                peers from Columbia College; they successfully hosted over 40 exhibitions and
                participated in art fairs, neighborhood festivals, and public art works. She taught
                courses at <em>Chicago Semester</em>, an off-campus program for college juniors and
                seniors, and <em>The Chicago Photography Center</em>.</p>
            <p>Since joining the History Center's staff in January of 2013, Marinaro has cultivated
                significant artifact and archival collections related to post-war Italian
                immigration to Western Pennsylvania, the Passionists' first monastery in North
                America, Italian folk-revival troupe <em>I Campagnoli</em>, former Vice Consul of
                Italy in Pittsburgh, Joseph D'Andrea, and local Italian American foodways
                businesses. Her research interests include post-war Italian immigration, Italian
                American identity (particularly in veterans), and oral history and storytelling as a
                research device. Marinaro is currently the Exhibition Review Editor for the journal
                    <em>The Italian American Review</em>.</p>

            <h4>Our Collaborators</h4>
            <p>This project, being multi-faceted and containing research from several specialties
                and academic domains, deeply thanks all the individuals and groups who personally
                contributed to development on the project. With students and faculty from multiple
                campuses all graciously investing their energy in this project, it's impossible to
                imagine that this project would have developed to its current point.</p>
            <p>Being that the Tuscan League's materials that we studied throughout this semester
                were a primary pedagogical resource for Dr. Insana and her translation workshop
                students in the fall of 2017, we are happy to thank the students from that class for
                the continued work that they developed in transcribing and translating the first 75
                pages of the first volume of Lega minutes. The student participants who contributed
                to the initial linguistic study of these documents are the following: Jenna
                Bernadino, Jordan Brewer, Jessica Cappellini, Zachary Enick, Maria Fenner, Eliza
                Jermyn, Rita Keil, Luke Langkamp, Kaleigh Mauroni, Archie Millar, Henry Novara, and
                Calvin Salazar. Of that group of students, Zachary, Eliza, Rita, and Archie were the
                four who decided to continue their own personal research projects on the Tuscan
                League after their first exposure to them in the classroom.</p>
            <p>Elisa Beshero-Bondar is an associate professor of English at the University of
                Pittsburgh, Greensburg campus, and she also serves as the sponsor for the Greensburg
                chapter of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.english.org/sigmatd/">Sigma Tau
                    Delta</a> and as the director of Greensburg's <a target="_blank"
                    href="http://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/digital-humanities/center-digital-text"
                    >Center for Digital Text.</a> Additionally, Elisa is a chair member of the <a
                    target="_blank" href="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Council/">TEI Technical
                    Council</a>, an eleven-person team that maintains and continues development of
                the TEI ecosystem, about which you can learn more in our <a href="aboutMethods.html"
                    >About the Methods</a> page. Elisa volunteered her expertise in text-encoding
                and TEI compliance and was the chief mentor for the portion of the project on social
                mapping of the members of the Lega. Additionally, Elisa facilitated an online
                collaboration of student digital humanists from the greater Pittsburgh area and
                abroad, all of whom comprised a weekly web conference to discuss new ditigal
                technologies and to develop individual DH projects.</p>
            <p>David J. Birnbaum is a professor and co-chair of the Department of Slavic Languages
                and Literature at the University of Pittsburgh. As a digital humanist, David is an
                internationally renowned specialist in electronic text processing. Along with Elisa
                Beshero-Bondar, he contributed personally and extensively in the development of the
                social mapping of the League's members and the rendering of the reading view of the
                minute logs.</p>
            <p>Lorraine Denman is an EdD candidate and a lecturer in the Italian department at the
                University of Pittsburgh in Oakland. In the Fall semester of 2018, Lorraine served
                as the linguistic advisor and mentor for the research surrounding the appearance of
                English loanwords in the volume of minutes.</p>
            <p>While the work for the spatial map was completed, for the most part, independently
                and under loose guidance, we thank the faculty from the Geology department at the
                University of Pittsburgh for the mentorship given to student researchers throughout
                the development of the geographical maps of Tuscan League's residences. You can read

            <h4>Our Online Sources</h4>
            <p>The online resources used for this project were a collection of free and paid
                databases, including some geneological websites, archived newspaper articles, and
                more, and they were used to compile the biological profiles of each of families that
                are discussed in our <a href="families.html">About the Lega</a> webpage. An itemized
                list of all the online resources and articles consulted for this project are listed
