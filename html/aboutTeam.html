            <h3>About the Researchers</h3>
            <p><em>Lina Insana</em> is Associate Professor of Italian and Chair of the Department of
                French &amp; Italian at the University of Pittsburgh, where she teaches the
                literature, film, and culture of post-Unification Italy; Holocaust literature and
                film; Italian Fascism and resistance; Italian American screen studies; and
                translation studies. Her published research has focused primarily on representations
                of the Holocaust, most notably in <cite>Arduous Tasks: Primo Levi, Translation, and
                    the Transmission of Holocaust Testimony</cite>, awarded the 2007 Scaglione
                Manuscript Prize by the MLA and the 2009 AAIS 20th c. book prize. Her current
                research engages theories of space and place, island studies, and critical geography
                to examine the discourses and cultural production that position Sicily within larger
                frameworks of belonging such as <q>Italy,</q>
                <q>Europe,</q>
                <q>the South,</q> and <q>the Mediterranean.</q> Her interest in the <em>Lega Toscana
                    di Protezione</em> stems from work on a longer-term project that examines
                US-based institutions of <em>italianità</em> in Italian <q>colonies</q> between the
                world wars.</p>
            <p><em>Zachary Enick</em> is a fifth-year senior at the University of Pittsburgh, with a
                double-major in French and Italian Language studies, a minor in Linguistics, and a
                certificate in American Sign Language. In the scope of this research, he was
                responsible for having performed the research of member activity and interactions in
                the Lega, and he also built this website. Zachary first began his Digital Humanities
                research in the spring of 2017 in the course Computational Methods in the
                Humanities, taught by the Slavic department chair, David Birnbaum. His specific
                interest in the <em>Lega Toscana di Protezione</em> was piqued in the Italian
                Translation Workshop course, taught by Professor Insana in the Fall of 2017. The
                document analyses performed in that course gave way to an interest in the dynamic of
                the members within the the League itself, which then materialized into his portion
                of the research presented here. In the Fall of 2018, Zachary was awarded the
                opportunity to continue his research on the Tuscan League with a research fellowship
                through the University of Pittsburgh Honors College's <a
                    href="https://www.honorscollege.pitt.edu/node/720">THINK Fellowship.</a>After
                his expected graduation date in spring of 2019, Zachary hopes to work
                internationally, either in graduate research or English education, before ultimately
                returning to school.</p>
            <p><em>Eliza Jermyn</em> graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in April 2018, with
                a major in Italian Language and Anthropology with a minor in Religious Studies. Her
                focus in this project was creating biographies for the more influential members of
                the Lega Toscana and understanding the kind of community they had created. This
                research provided a chance for Eliza to integrate the areas of study that have
                mostly remained separate throughout her college career. To do that, she used online
                databases like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ancestry.com/">Ancestry</a> and
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newspapers.com/">Newspapers</a> and the
                material resources provided by the Heinz History Center to collect primary sources
                that would allow her to create a more personal picture of who the Tuscan League's
                members were and how they existed in Pittsburgh. Her plans following graduation are
                to remain at the University of Pittsburgh and pursue a Master’s degree in
                Italian.</p>
            <p><em>Archie Millar</em> graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in the April 2018
                with a major in Italian Language &amp; Literature as well as Geology. His primary
                focus throughout this project was the continuation and standardization of the
                transcription and translation of the first volume of minutes from the Tuscan League,
                part of which had already been completed as part of Professor Insana’s Translation
                Workshop during Fall 2017. He enjoyed being able to interact with the minutes
                directly, delving into the inner workings of this Pittsburgh community, and was
                excited to be able to continue working on the translation leg of the project as he
                was able to gain experience with translation of archival materials but also because
                he feels it increases the accessibility of these resources to the wider, non-Italian
                speaking community. Following his August 2018 graduation, Archie has no serious
                plans and hopes to take some time to travel and run around in the mountains.</p>
            <p><em>Rita Keil</em> graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in April 2018 with a
                double major in Italian Language &amp; Literature and Environmental Science, and
                with certificates in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and West European Studies.
                This Tuscan League project served as her GIS capstone experience. For the project,
                she collected location data from the Leauge's meeting minutes and application forms
                and geocoded the data to show which Pittsburgh neighborhoods were most important to
                the its members over time. She was excited to work on this project because it
                combined her interests in Italian studies and data visualization. Following her
                graduation in April 2018, Rita plans on working in GIS and then returning to school
                for graduate studies.</p>
