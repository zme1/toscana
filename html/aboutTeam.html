            <h3 class="about">About the Researchers</h3>
            <p><span class="name">Lina Insana</span> is Associate Professor of Italian and Chair of
                the Department of French &amp; Italian at the University of Pittsburgh, where she
                teaches the literature, film, and culture of post-Unification Italy; Holocaust
                literature and film; Italian Fascism and resistance; Italian American screen
                studies; and translation studies. Her published research has focused primarily on
                representations of the Holocaust, most notably in Arduous Tasks: Primo Levi,
                Translation, and the Transmission of Holocaust Testimony, awarded the 2007 Scaglione
                Manuscript Prize by the MLA and the 2009 AAIS 20th c. book prize. Her current
                research engages theories of space and place, island studies, and critical geography
                to examine the discourses and cultural production that position Sicily within larger
                frameworks of belonging such as <q>Italy</q>, <q>Europe</q>, <q>the South</q>, and <q>the
                Mediterranean.</q> Her interest in the <q>Lega Toscana di Protezione</q> stems from work on
                a longer-term project that examines US-based institutions of italianit√† in Italian
                <q>colonies</q> between the world wars.</p>
            <p><span class="name">Zachary Enick</span> is a fourth-year student at the University of
                Pittsburgh, with a double-major in French and Italian Language studies, a minor in
                Linguistics, and a certificate in American Sign Language. In the scope of this
                research, he was responsible for having performed the research of member activity
                and interactions in the Lega, and he also built the website. Zachary first began his
                Digital Humanities research in the spring of 2017 in the course Computational
                Methods in the Humanities, taught by the Slavic department chair, David Birnbaum.
                His specific interest in the Lega Toscana di Protezione was piqued in the Italian
                Translation Workshop course, taught by Professor Insana in the Fall of 2017. The
                document analyses performed in that course gave way to an interest in the dynamic of
                the members within the the Lega itself, which then materialized into his portion of
                the research presented here. After his expected graduation date in spring of 2019,
                Zachary hopes to work internationally, either in graduate research or English
                education, before ultimately returning to school.</p>
            <p><span class="name">Eliza Jermyn</span> is a senior at the University of Pittsburgh,
                majoring in Italian Language and Anthropology with a minor in Religious Studies. Her
                focus in this project was creating biographies for the more active members of the
                Lega Toscana and understanding the kind of community they had created. This research
                provided a chance for Eliza to integrate the areas of study that have mostly
                remained separated throughout her college career. To do that, she used online
                databases like Ancestry and Newspapers and the material resources provided by the
                Heinz History Center.</p>
