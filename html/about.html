            <h3 class="about">About the Project</h3>

            <p>The project is an extension of a Translation Studies course taught this (fall 2181)
                semester by Prof. Lina Insana, in which a large part of the students' final
                portfolio work involved the transcription and translation of archival materials from
                the Heinz History Center's Italian American Collection. In particular, they've
                collectively translated about 75 pp of the meeting minutes of the Lega Toscana di
                Protezione [Tuscan League], a beneficial society in existence from 1915 until the
                mid-1970s and made up of Tuscan immigrants to Pittsburgh. The minute books' first
                years are written in Italian and their transcription/translation of these materials
                is the first work being done with them. Since these students now have a unique
                familiarity with these materials, the class was offered the opportunity to continue
                their work in different directions next semester, in the form of a research
                collective.</p>
            <p>Prof. Lina Insana (Assoc. Prof. of Italian; Chair of the Department of French &amp;
                Italian) will be the project leader and supervisor. She is a scholar of
                post-Unification Italy and has published on Italian American culture and history;
                she has a particular and emerging interest in the institutional life of Italian
                immigrant communities during the interwar period. Four students have elected to join
                the project through various research (ITAL 1909, Undergraduate Research
                Assistantship) or capstone credits (GEOL 1901 Independent Study). Their collective
                work on a concise group of research questions will leverage the students’ knowledge
                of the Tuscan community in Pittsburgh, the activities of the Tuscan League, and
                information about its members. The four students bring several distinct research
                disciplines to the table. You can read more about the students and their individual
                contributions to this research project in our <a href="aboutTeam.html">About the
                    Researchers</a> page. </p>
            <p>There were a host of primary and auxiliary questions that were the driving force
                behind this project, and some of them were the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What was the Tuscan League’s composition, both in terms of membership and
                    leadership? To what degree was this community an insulated group within the
                    larger context of the Italian immigrant community (i.e., Calabresi, Molisani,
                    etc.)? Did they marry within or beyond their group; was their group
                    characterized by common religious and labor sites; etc.? 2. Where did this
                    community live?</li>
                <li>Where did this community live?</li>
                <li>Where and in what sectors did this community work? (we know that many League
                    members—the Polis, Tambellinis, Barsottis, DeLucas, etc.—ended up being central
                    figures in Pittsburgh’s Italian food scene)</li>
                <li>What was the relationship between their residential and labor footprints in
                    Pittsburgh, and how did this footprint evolve over time?</li>
                <li>What was the Tuscan League’s relationship (nature and frequency of contact) to
                    other regionally-defined immigrant clubs, beneficial societies, and chapters of
                    larger associations?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A number of local partners are very interested in this work and its results. The
                Heinz History Center has invited the students to be guest bloggers on their site,
                posts that will be republished in the Italian American Collection’s Bollettino
                (newsletter). They also invited us to present our research to the Italian
                American Collection Advisory Council at their April 2018 meeting. Finally, we will
                participate in a scholarly conferences and present our work in a panel on “Italian
                Studies in the Digital Age” at the Canadian Society for Italian Studies (Ottawa, May
                2018) and at the Keystone DH Conference (Penn State, July 2018).</p>
