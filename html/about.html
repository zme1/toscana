            <h3 class="about">About the Project</h3>

            <p>The project is an extension of a Translation Studies course taught this (fall 2181)
                semester by Prof. Lina Insana, in which a large part of the students' final
                portfolio work involved the transcription and translation of archival materials from
                the Heinz History Center's Italian American Collection. In particular, they've
                collectively translated about 75 pp of the meeting minutes of the Lega Toscana di
                Protezione [Tuscan League], a beneficial society in existence from 1915 until the
                mid-1970s and made up of Tuscan immigrants to Pittsburgh. The minute books' first
                years are written in Italian and their transcription/translation of these materials
                is the first work being done with them. Since these students now have a unique
                familiarity with these materials, the class was offered the opportunity to continue
                their work in different directions next semester, in the form of a research
                collective.</p>
